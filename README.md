# Scraping political speeches

This is a repository of scripts and data required to replicate various datasets of political speeches, including:
 * [Hansard maiden speeches](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/hansard-maiden-speeches): maiden speeches given by new British MPs from 1945 onwards, using debate transcripts scraped from Hansard - includes speech content, MP names, constituencies, party, maiden speech date, parliamentary cohort, Hansard reference and column, and the topic of the debate during which they gave their maiden speech.
 * [British Political Speech](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/british-political-speech): leaders' speeches at party conferences, available at [BritishPoliticalSpeech.org](http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm), scraped into a dataframe and cleaned - includes speech content, politicians' names, party, year, location, commentary on the speech, and tags.
