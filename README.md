# Scraping political speeches

This is a repository of scripts and data required to replicate various datasets of political speeches, including:
 * [**Hansard in full**](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/hansard-in-full): Parliamentary speeches matched to individual MPs with party and biographic information, using the [TheyWorkForYou database](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/). **[Under development // TO DO: Integrate with the [History of Parliament Online](https://membersafter1832.historyofparliamentonline.org/about) dataset]**
 * [**Hansard maiden speeches**](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/hansard-maiden-speeches): maiden speeches given by new British MPs from 1945 onwards, using debate transcripts scraped from Hansard - includes speech content, MP names, constituencies, party, maiden speech date, parliamentary cohort, Hansard reference and column, and the topic of the debate during which they gave their maiden speech.
 * [**Hansard PMQs**](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/hansard-pmqs): maiden speeches given by new British MPs from 1945 onwards, using debate transcripts scraped from Hansard - includes speech content, date. **[Under development // TO DO: Integrate with HOPO MPs dataset for biographical information on MPs]**

 * [**Manifesto forewords**](https://www.github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/manifesto-forewords): uses the [Manifesto Project archive](https://visuals.manifesto-project.wzb.eu/mpdb-shiny/cmp_dashboard_dataset/) to extract forewords from party leaders and senior figures to British election manifestos from 1983 to present. **[Under development // TO DO: Complete from 1997-present]**

 * [**Local election leaflets**](https://www.github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/local-election-leaflets): based on the [Election Leaflets archive](https://electionleaflets.org/?msclkid=9708dcc1d11b11eca98f44acf2e3bb5f), using optical character recognition to convert images of local election leaflets to plain text, then annotating with scraped data about constituencies, parties, and candidates. **[Under development]**
