# Scraping political speeches

This is a repository of scripts and data required to replicate various datasets of political speeches, including:
 * [**Hansard in full**](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/hansard-in-full): Parliamentary speeches matched to individual MPs with party and biographic information, using the [TheyWorkForYou database](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/).
 * [**Hansard PMQs**](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/hansard-pmqs): maiden speeches given by new British MPs from 1945 onwards, using debate transcripts scraped from Hansard - includes speech content, date.
 * [**Conference speeches**](https://github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/conference-speeches): leaders' speeches at party conferences, available at [BritishPoliticalSpeech.org](http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm), scraped into a dataframe and cleaned - includes speech content, politicians' names, party, year, location, commentary on the speech, and tags.
 * [**Manifesto forewords**](https://www.github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/manifesto-forewords): uses the [Manifesto Project archive](https://visuals.manifesto-project.wzb.eu/mpdb-shiny/cmp_dashboard_dataset/) to extract forewords to British election manifestos - written by party leaders from Labour, Conservatives, Lib Dems, SNP, and UKIP/Brexit Party - from 1983 to present.
 * [**Local election leaflets**](https://www.github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/local-election-leaflets): based on the [Election Leaflets archive](https://electionleaflets.org/?msclkid=9708dcc1d11b11eca98f44acf2e3bb5f), using optical character recognition to convert images of local election leaflets to plain text, then annotating with scraped data about constituencies, parties, and candidates. **[Under development]**
 * [**Party press releases**](https://www.github.com/nrbailey/scraping-political-speeches/tree/master/party-press-releases): press releases scraped from party websites for Labour and the Conservatives. **[Under development]**
