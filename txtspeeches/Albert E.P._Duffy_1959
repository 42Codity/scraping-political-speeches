I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, at the end to add: and the Minister shall lay a copy of every such report before Parliament"". Although we may have the best will in the world, we are entitled to have some doubts about the scope and character of the Central Training Council. We may contend at this stage that it should be no more than a central co-ordinating authority. But I think that even this modest rÃ´le is bound to lead to the establishment of certain standards of training which in turn will give some indication of the lines of research that are necessary, which in its turn will lead to the provision of a nucleus of an inspectorate. Moreover, the impact of technological advances will compel the continuous adaptation of training services as well as drawing the Central Training Council more and moreâ€”in collaboration with the Ministry's new manpower research unitâ€”into forecasting future requirements of manpower not only in a given industry but in a given occupation. Who is better placed to comment on these trends and developments than experts and specialists of the kind whom we hope it is proposed to recruit to the Council? Who is better placed to comment on these developments than a chairman of the calibre the Minister said in Committee he was seeking for the Council? The reports from such men and women deserve the widest possible audience. In other words, the reports should be discussed in this House. These reports should be presented to the House not merely for the information that they will provide, not merely for their statistical value, nor merely for the purpose of comparing what happened the year before: they should  be presented to achieve what in the early stages may be the greatest requirement of all, namely, the widest possible publicity. We have ample precedents for annual reports to Parliament. The Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, and other Departments which deal with social problems present such reports. These reports contain statistics which can be compared with what happened in previous years. They have a genuine value, and I think that an annual report in this case would be especially welcome. During the Committee stage I asked the Minister whether he would be kind enough to ask the Council to make a report on its activities, and he agreed to do so. I am now asking him whether he will be gracious enough to publish a copy of such a report in the House.
