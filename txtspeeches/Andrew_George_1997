I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to make my maiden speech. I congratulate hon. Members on the quality of their maiden speeches, which I shall try to match. I should like to take this opportunity to make a bit of history by saying: Me am beth hanow Heb dewath ha bry Bisgwethack rag nevra Those words are Cornish. They were spoken by a blacksmith from St. Keverne, in my constituency, where I come from. That blacksmith was known locally as ""An Got', which is Cornish for the smith, and was called Michael Joseph. He led an uprising from the constituency just one month short of 500 years ago. This weekend, that uprising will be re-enacted when a large band of Cornish people will march 330 miles to London to celebrate and commemorate the Cornishmen's storming of London. Sadly, that attack was not as successful as we would have liked.
