Some days ago, Mr. Speaker, when you were re-elected to your high office, tributes were paid to you from all sections of the House as to the assistance you had been to all hon. Members. You were also reputed to be the protector of minorities. I stand before you today, Sir, as an hon. Member who belongs to a minority party in this House and as someone very much in need of a friend, as a poor, fledgling newcomer to this ancient House. The speech I shall make to you today is  on behalf of a very large number of people in two countries, Scotland and Walesâ€”two countries which are small in area but which have contributed tremendously to the day-to-day advancement of our lives, not only here but also abroad. An increasingly large number of people in those two countries have for some time wanted an opportunity to have their own Governments to deal with their own domestic affairs. In order to sound the opinion of the Scottish people, and without the benefit of any high-pressure organisation or Press campaign, an organisation known as Scottish Convention, which is a non-political body, recently sent out a questionnaire, which they called the Covenant form, to various parts of Scotland. This people were asked, of their own free will, to sign if they believed in the establishment of a Government in Scotland to deal with Scotland's domestic affairs. Over one million people signed that Covenant within a few weeks. To give some indication that this matter finds very much favour with the average Scottish person, may I point out that the constituency I have the honour to represent is one which gives a very good cross-section of Scottish life? We are the centre of the tweed and hosiery trades, two of the greatest dollar earners for this country, and we also have some of the most progressive farmers in the whole of Scotland. In one of our towns, Selkirk, with 6,000 inhabitants, nearly 3,000 people signed this Covenant within a very few weeks. I give that as an example to show that this demand is not confined to fanatical small groups, but represents every section of Scottish life. What are the domestic affairs for Scotland about which we talk? They are health, housing, transport, education, agriculture, industry, finance and taxation. We wish to leave to the Government in Westminster, to which Scotland would send representatives, such subjects as defence and foreign policy, because we realise that we are one island, and Customs and Excise, because we do not want to make smuggling a profitable profession on the Border. Those hon. Members from Scotland would attend this House only when such subjects were being discussed. What would be the advantages of self-government to Scotland? Let me deal,   first, with trade. To a great extent Scottish trade is very different from that of England, because England does not grow sufficient food for her own requirements, whereas Scotland grows more than enough food for herself and exports the surplus to England. Much of the money which England receives from her export trade must be used for the purchase of food to keep her people alive, whereas Scotland, because she is able to grow sufficient food for her own requirements, is able to use the proceeds of her trade in whisky, tweeds, hosiery, shipbuilding and her many other industries for the purchase of building materials, machinery and equipment to develop her country. Therefore, if Scotland had her own Government her housing problems might quite easily be solved within a very few years, particularly as Scotland would be able first to give priority to the needs of the rural population and the industrial population, and then to turn to her residential areas. The second of the many advantages which Scotland would receive through having her own Government, as I understand them, is that she would then be able to cushion her very serious unemployment figures when mass unemployment or a slump hit this country. At the moment Scotland is to a great extent dependent upon her heavy industries, whereas if she had her own Government she would be able to take steps to attract to Scotland a vast number of light industries to weave into the general pattern of her industry and cushion her unemployment, should it occur. The third point is the question of immigration. It has become an almost established fact for people in England to regard Scotland as just one of those countries which breeds immigrants. But as a rule Scottish men and women do not want to leave their country if they can find opportunities in their own country. It may be of interest to this House to know that from 1921 to 1939 600,000 people left Scotland. A few of those people may have wanted to leave, but the great majority had to leave because there was no opportunity for them in Scotland. I have met many of those people on my travels abroad and to those who have succeeded I have often said, ""You must be very glad that you left Scotland and you must be very proud  of your success."" In practically every case they have said to me, ""We are proud of our success, but we wish we had never had to leave Scotland; that is our home, that is where our background, our relatives and our interests lie; we should never have left the country had we been able to find reasonable opportunities there."" If self-government is granted to Scotland then opportunities can be provided, because Scotland is latently a very rich country. She has great hydroelectric schemes, rich coal deposits, rich farm land, large fisheries, about which we shall hear later, and she also has iron and aluminium deposits and the craftmanship of her many industries. Scottish men and women have gone all over the world; they have shown that they are realists, and balanced citizens. Is it too much to believe that if they are given the government of their own country they can make a great success of it? It is not simply a theory in which we are asking the House to believe. We can point across the Irish Channel to the wonderful success of the Government in Northern Ireland in helping to bring prosperity to the million people there, or to the Isle of Man, which has its own Government, or to the Channel Islands, which have their own Government. Each part of the United Kingdom which I have mentioned is prosperous and I fervently believe that if this opportunity is given to Scotland and Wales they can be very much more prosperous than they are today, for the benefit of us all. The Scottish National Assembly, which is a non-political body, will be sending representatives to London before the end of April and I want this House to appoint a small Select Committee, drawn equally from the Scottish Members of the three parties which compose this House, to meet the representatives of that Assembly. Such a Committee may be sure that from the representatives it will receive expert knowledge on every side of Scottish life. I should like the Select Committee to draw up a brief report for submission to this House next Session, so that a decision could be taken at an early date on this vital matter. In conclusion, on behalf of a very large section of people of Scotland and Wales I ask this House to grant self-government to Scotland and Wales so that, during   the life of this present Parliament of Westminster. these two countries may hold their respective elections and set up their own Governments without delay. Before I sit down may I make this plea to hon. Members of this House? There are hundreds of thousands of people in those two countries who have no bitterness in their hearts, but who very earnestly demand this great reform. I plead with this House. and particularly with the Conservative and Socialist Parties, to give that reform to them before this question becomes a bitter one through frustration and before it follows in the unhappy course of the Irish question. I cannot feel that there is any disadvantage either to Socialists or Conservatives in this House in granting this freedom to those sections of the British community who have proved that they are adult and know their responsibilities and will carry them out to the full. I ask the House to give to those countries a fair deal in this matter.
