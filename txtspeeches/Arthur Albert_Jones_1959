May I ask the Leader of the House whether, in view of the importance of this subject to the future prosperity of these islands, he would set aside a day in the immediate future in which the House could debate the provision of a wholly-owned British satellite telecommunications system, coordinated within the Commonwealth? In view of an occurrence only a few hours ago, would he give it his favourable consideration as neither time nor space is on our side?
