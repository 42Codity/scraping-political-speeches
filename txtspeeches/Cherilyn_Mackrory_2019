It is a true honour to be standing here today as the newly elected representative for Truro and Falmouthâ€”a whirlwind for me and my little family, as I was a candidate only for five weeks before polling day. Cornwall, my adopted homeâ€”but to which my husband, my daughter and even my dog are nativeâ€”has welcomed me warmly, and I would like to show my gratitude to my constituents by being a force for good in this role and a genuine help to all residents, regardless of how or whether they voted in December. I am happy to say that it is a pleasure to pay tribute to my predecessor. Sarah Newton entered this place in 2010 and has always been a staunch advocate for securing  fairer funding for Cornwall. It is largely thanks to Sarahâ€™s efforts, along with her Cornish colleagues at the time, that we are now expecting a women and childrenâ€™s facility at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, along with a further Â£450 million for the NHS in Cornwall. Sarah also ensured a stable future for Falmouth docks for the first time in years. Sarah served as a Minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, and spoke passionately in this place several times in defence of the most vulnerable people in our society. Colleagues across the House have spoken very fondly of Sarah, paying tribute particularly to her compassion and kindness. On this I can concur. Having been a candidate for such a short time before my election, I have found her help invaluable. She even put me up for my first week in Parliament, and that is going above and beyond. I am sure that Members across the House will join me in wishing Sarah all the very best for her future endeavours. I am very lucky to represent Truro and Falmouth. It is a fantastic constituency, from the beautiful rugged and windswept north coast to the equally beautiful rolling and gentle south coastâ€”there are no favourites here! It makes the bulk of its fortunes from fishing, farming and tourism. However, we also have exciting emerging industries such as geothermal energy, lithium extraction, and the potential for floating offshore wind farmsâ€”not forgetting theatre, breweries, surfing, sailing, a thriving arts and food culture, campuses for two universities, and more besides. Falmouth was my first home when I came to Cornwall, and I can testify first hand as to why it regularly makes The Times â€œhappiest places to liveâ€ lists. Last year, The Times described Falmouth as â€œas close as Britain gets to the California/Barcelona city-by-the-sea lifestyle.â€ I would agree, except more so once it stops raining. It has not actually stopped raining since August. Falmouth boasts the third deepest natural harbour in the world after Sydney and Rio, which is why fishing and sailing exist alongside a healthy working docksâ€”and that is so important to the economy. Cornwall has always been outward-looking and seafaring. Evidence of overseas trade exists as far back as the bronze age. In 1805, news of Britainâ€™s victory and Nelsonâ€™s death at Trafalgar was landed at Falmouth and taken by stagecoach to London. Truro is Cornwallâ€™s only city. It is the base of Cornish local government, fantastic shopping, and, with the completion of the Hall for Cornwall later this year, also its centre for culture. The reopening of this hugely important establishment means that we can welcome over 200,000 people a year through its doors. It will also house space for creative start-ups. It is set to transform the centre of Truro, as well as being a game-changer for Cornwall as a whole. My family is my inspirationâ€”and by the way, I am lucky enough to have the best one of those as well. My mum and dadâ€”Gordon and Olwyn Williamsâ€”and my big sisters have guided me through all my experiences and continue with their unending encouragement. It is the compassion that I have inherited from them that will drive me in my work in this place. My wonderful husband, Nick, is endlessly patient, and his determination for work defies belief for most people; and we have our precious daughter Chloe, whose future I want to help  make the happiest it can be. I love them all, and I could not be doing this without their unwavering support. This is a definite team effort. I am the wife of a hook-and-line fisherman with an under-10 metre vessel. When he rings to say that he is still an hour away from safety and the weather has taken a turn for the worse that was not forecast, I can tell you now that the dread is palpable. We need to champion our small boats in any fishing deal that is coming our way. Their job is precarious enough. We need to support our coastal communities to brave the elements and thrive in the 21st century. There are opportunities on the horizon, and we need to grab them with both hands and bring them home. I am very proud to be part of this one nation Conservative party committed to being a world leader for conservation. I am also proud to represent the constituency where Surfers Against Sewage is located. It is one of the UKâ€™s leading environmental organisations and has pioneered work to protect our seas and waterways from plastic pollution as well as to improve water quality. I have been passionate about looking after the natural environment for longer than I can remember. It has always been instinctive to me that this is just something we should do; we did not need to be told to do it. This Environment Bill is bold. It will help to deliver the Governmentâ€™s manifesto promise of the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on this earth, and I fully support its progress. I recommend much of its content, particularly with regard to waste management and nature recovery. I would like to see the south-west exceed the targets in it. I am very, very ambitious for this. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of Stateâ€”my neighbour as the Member for Camborne and Redruthâ€”on his new appointment and on his work to date. I would like to see a bigger reduction in the consumption of single-use plastic. I think we can do this as a society. We do not need to spend resources clearing it up. It is going to take a culture change. We are all consumers and it has to come from us. We will need help from industry to make it convenient for consumers and also good value for money. That is the way we will make it happen. I would like to see greater checks and balances on our interim targets to ensure that we can stay on track in the short term as well as the long term. That is a recipe for success. I would like to see a greater commitment to managing our oceans. If we do not look after the marine environment, we will have no fishing industry in Cornwall. The saying is, â€œGive a man a fish and you will feed him for a day, but teach him how to fish and you will feed him for a lifetime.â€ The Cornish are innovative, bold, and incredibly capable. It is my job to make sure that Cornwall gets the investment, the levelling up of funding and a fair chance so that my constituents and our children have the opportunity to swim, not sink. There is so much for Cornwall and the great south-west to be ambitious about. My constituents are determined, driven, and by far the most adaptable people I have met, and it will be my job to help make sure that we are ambitious for the future.
