Although this is an improvement on the position last year, it is still not wholly satisfactory. I confess I take the view that it is wrong   to have Summer Time at all, although that is not a matter under discussion today. I would remind the House that our Scottish friends are not the only people who have to suffer on account of this late ending of Summer Time. In Yorkshire, we also have a heavy dew in the autumn. A point we must bear in mind is that food production efficiency is as much in the interest of the townsman as of the rural areas, and that efficiency and cost of production bear today more precisely upon consumers in the towns than they did before the war. The argument advanced by the Home Secretary, that electricity undertakings are concerned in this matter, seems to me to require more explanation. I was not aware that the industrial and domestic load was particularly heavy in the first few weeks of October. When the cold weather starts, there is some strength in their argument, but we get serious spells of cold weather early in November and also in the middle of the month. I feel that we have a right to an explanation and some figures which will prove that the electricity load requires to be eased by this extension of Summer Time beyond the date of 8th October. Finally, I should like to reinforce what has been said by my hon. Friends. It seems to me that to pass Acts of Parliament to make the urban population of this country get up an hour earlier than would otherwise be the case, is nothing short of crazy.
