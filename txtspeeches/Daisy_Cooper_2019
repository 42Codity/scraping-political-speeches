It is a great honour to make my maiden speech following many other accomplished and passionate speakers. My constituency of St Albans is very proud of its contribution both to Britainâ€™s history and to Britainâ€™s place in the world. Alban himself is the first recorded Christian martyr and Britainâ€™s first saint. He was executed for giving shelter to a stranger fleeing persecution, and his grave is a site of pilgrimage to this day. Then there is Magna Carta, the great charter of liberties, which has shaped democracies around the world. The very first meetings that led to the drafting of that charter were held in St Albans Abbey. Today, the abbey is surrounded by pubsâ€”lots and lots of pubs. St Albans has more pubs per square mile than any other place in Great Britain and they are steeped in our nationâ€™s history, too.
