In rising to speak in this Chamber for the first time, I hope that I may claim the customary indulgence of the Committee. These words seem to be becoming rather infectious in this debate, and we know how narrowly the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher), who has now left the Chamber, escaped the unprecedented situation of being sandwiched between two ""maidens."" It is a great honour to me to be privileged to follow the late Member for Orpington who was, I know, much respected on both sides of the Committee for his great natural good will and individuality. Hon. Members of whatever seniority will not have forgotten how they felt when they first took their place in the House of Commons, and how they wondered what lay before them. I could not have anticipated, when I made my humble arrival here towards the end of January,   however important I might have thought it was, that such great events would be set in trainâ€”that we should see the marked dissension on the Benches opposite manifesting itself, that we should have the resignation of a Prime Minister, the announcement of a General Election, and finally the presentation of the Budget and a draft Finance Bill of an unusual if not unique character. I should like humbly to congratulate the Chancellor on his Budget proposals. They may well come to be held up as a model of how to achieve the most good with the minimum of detail. I will try to be as non-contentious as possible, difficult though that may be at this moment of time, but I must confess to feeling surprised by what has been said by hon. Members opposite, most recently by the hon. Member for Islington, East when he described this as an electioneering Budget. One wonders what the Opposition expected. Would the Chancellor have done right if he had done nothing for anybody?
