I beg to move, in page 21, line 46, at the end, to insert: (7) This Section shall have effect in its application to Scotland, as if for Subsection (3) the following Subsection were substituted: (3) Not later than the date on which any scheme made under Section twenty of this Act is submitted to the Minister by the council of a county, the council shall send a copy of the scheme to the town council of each small burgh in the county and the Minister before approving the scheme shall take into consideration any representations by any such town council made with respect to the scheme within one month from the date on which it was submitted to the Minister. The reason for this Amendment is substantially the same as that given for the immediately preceding Amendment, save in its application to Scotland. Hon. Gentlemen will recollect that Clause 20 provides that a local authority shall, in certain circumstances, provide accommodation. The provision of accommodation is also the concern of small burghs, and accordingly the Amendment provides that the schemes prepared by the county councils shall be intimated to the small burghs for their observations to the Secretary of State before they come into effect. I regret that the suggestion made in the Committee that there should also be intimation to the district councils cannot be   given effect to, the reason being that the district councils are substantially the same persons as those who are on the county councils.
