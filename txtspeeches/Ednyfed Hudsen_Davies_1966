I heartily support this Bill. As a new Member rising to speak for the first time, I ask for the indulgence of the House. Conway constituency, which I have the honour to represent, has in the past been most fortunate in its representatives. I should like to pay particular tribute to the right hon. Peter Thomas, the previous Member for the constituency, who was highly esteemed in the House and in the constituency. He and I are very close friends, and I am happy to say that our political conflict has in no way marred the warmth and sincerity of our friendship. The constituency in its present form was created after the war, and there are still many in the House, who remember with great affection the presence here of Mr. Elwyn Jones, who was the first Member for the Conway constituency. Part of the constituencyâ€”the part incorporated in the then Caernarvon Boroughsâ€”was represented by David Lloyd George, and, as the first Welshman to speak today, I should like to pay my tribute, and I know that of everyone in Wales and in the House, to the memory of that great and dear lady, Megan Lloyd George.
