May I crave the indulgence of the House in what every hon. Member regards as a major ordeal. If the tolerance of hon. Members matches the kindness which I have been shown since I arrived last Tuesday, there is no doubt about my ultimate emergence from this test. One of my illustrious predecessors who represented the same area of the country, that widely respected and well-loved miners' leader Bob Smillie, began his maiden speech with the quotation: Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey Where wealth accumulates and men decay. To some extent, in looking round my constituency, the setting in its modern context seems very much the same. Coal, railways and shipbuilding are very much in decline, and, despite the magnificent efforts of the local authorities in the area, who have made supreme efforts to bring new industries into the district, unemployment continues to rise. The real issue on the basis of rising unemployment is, of course, the failure to attract some of the industries from the areas that have been discussed this afternoon. The length of the unemployment period is increasing. School-leavers, who in the past two years have generally been offered jobs, training and apprenticeships in the Midlands, Luton, Slough, and other car-producing areas of Britain, are finding that this supply is drying up. While I am not happy about youngsters leaving their homes during their formative years, the car industry and its related trades nevertheless cushioned the   full impact of unemployment in the north-east of England. However, as we have heard this afternoon, that avenue is closing. Although we have no car industry in Blyth or in the north-east of England, nowhere will this debate be followed more closely than in that corner of the north-east of England which I am now proud and privileged to represent. In the expansion of the car industry and its ancillary industries lies much of the hope of bringing new industry to the area and staving off the effect of pit closures, railway redundancies and the lack of orders in the local shipyards. I am grateful to my Conservative opponent in the by-election for accurately summing up the Government's policy in relation to the area when he said that the affluent society had stopped short at the borders of Northumberland. The impression is being created in the countryâ€”and I think that I can claim to have a closer contact with it than many hon. Members at the momentâ€”that we are creating a Britain for some people to profit in, and a Britain in which it is held in higher regard to work with two telephones than with two hands. There are two factors in the car industry which must receive the closest possible examination. We all deplore the decline in the industry, but its impact is being felt elsewhere. New techniques of production, and new metals, for example the use of aluminium in place of strip steel, are bound to create uncertainty of employment in many areas. If these industrial problems are not tackled by the Government, they will be increased and aggravated by the monopolistic tendencies we are seeing at the moment in the motor industry which is dominated by four major firms, two of them British and two of them American. While that is the situation tonight, no one knows precisely what will be the position when we open our morning papers tomorrow. My constituents depend for their livelihood mainly on mining. There have been attacks on miners from time to time, but we in the Blyth constituency know the value of the contribution made by the mining communities of Britain to the magnificent recovery of the country's economy following the most destructive war in history. Having spent  the first six of the post-war years in the car-producing area of Birmingham, I know how dependent and appreciative the industrial workers of that car city were of the miners' efforts, efforts which were made in the face of superhuman difficulties. In supporting the Amendment, may I be permitted to call upon the Government to take immediate action to consider the future of the motor industry, and also to remember that in any examination or inquiry which may be made we should like consideration to be given to the spread of the motor industry throughout the country. It is obvious, from what has been said that the economy of the country will for a long time depend on the industry we are discussing. If, under the present Government, we get round to the question of expansion, we must consider the siting of plant and factories in the north-east of England, and in particular in my constituency, where we have the docking and transport facilities to handle, not only the import of raw materials needed for the trade, but the export of the finished article as well. We have within our ranks in that area the industrial workers who have the skill and craftsmanship which can readily adapt itself to any new task. The workers there have a skill and craftsmanship which goes back to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. The rails on which Stephenson's Rocket ran were made in Bedlington in the constituency of Blyth, and what we were able to do at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution we can repeat in the second half of the twentieth century. By tackling the immense problems that have been presented by the challenge of a new age the Government may have to turn their backs on some of their traditional policies, but turn their backs on them they must if we are to prevent the situation to which I referred earlier, and if we are to check the unhappy accumulation of wealth and the decay of men in our industrial areas.
