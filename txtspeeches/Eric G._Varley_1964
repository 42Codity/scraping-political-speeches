I am indeed grateful for the opportunity I have been given of making my maiden speech today, and I ask for the  indulgence of the House in doing so. I represent the constituency of Chesterfield, which many hon. Members will know for its crooked church spire. We in Chesterfield are proud of many other things. One of them is our claim to be the centre of industrial England. Whilst we may be out a few miles, geographically speaking, there is a vast amount of industry of all kinds in Chesterfield. We have coal and iron, on which I intend to speak later, and all types of engineering, both heavy and light. We have chemicals and surgical dressings. We are extremely proud of the industrial diversification that there is in Chesterfield. Hon. Members will remember that only a few years ago the decision was taken by the House to disperse the Postmaster-General's Accountant-General's Department. This, too, went to Chesterfield as part of the decision to disperse the Civil Service from London. The Chesterfield Municipal Borough, the Urban District of Staveley and the Parish of Brimington, which forms part of my constituency, are truly a microcosm of England. It would be appropriate on this occasion for me to mention my predecessor, Sir George Benson. Sir George served the House for over 30 years. He first represented Chesterfield in 1923. I know that he was greatly respected on both sides of the House for his work in the Public Accounts Committee and as Chairman of the Library Committee. His views and studies in connection with penal reform, I know, are admired and respected by everybody. In fact, Sir George set a very high standard. I am fortunate in having an opportunity to speak in this debate, which is extremely controversial and contentious. Although I have no desire to break with convention and be extremely controversialâ€”no doubt I shall get an opportunity of being controversial on a future occasionâ€”I want to draw the attention of the House to the anxieties of the people working in iron and steel in my constituency. Some hon. Members will be aware that Stewarts & Lloyds have two works in Chesterfield. One is called the Sheepbridge Company; the other is called Stanton and Staveley. I know the Staveley part of Stanton and Staveley particularly well, because I   began an engineering apprenticeship there in 1947. Both the Sheepbridge and the Staveley works were nationalised round about the 1950 period. They were practically two of the last ones to be denationalised in 1960. Incidentally, the Staveley works was sold back from the Government to Stewarts & Lloyds for Â£8Â½ million. The Government had paid about Â£10Â½ million for it, so that there was a Â£2 million loss. I know that this has already received the attention of the House. I mention this recent history, because it was when these two companies were denationalised that the troubles began to emerge in my constituency. In view of the facts, there is little wonder at the concern which emerged at that time. In 1960 the two works I have named employed approximately 5,800. There has been about a 20 per cent, reduction, so that today they employ only just over 4,000. In 1960 there were six blast furnaces in the constituency. Today, there are only two. Two of the furnacesâ€”those at Sheepbridgeâ€”were regarded as being the most modern in the country. In fact, they were only 10 years old. They had what many people considered to be adequate capacity. As soon as they were bought by Stewarts & Lloyds, they were immediately closed and 500 men were declared redundant practically overnight. During the economic troubles of 1962, which all hon. Members will remember, the general position in Chesterfield was extremely distressing. There was short-time working, and there were redundancies. I know that hon. Members will appreciate that when I speak of these grave anxieties which were there in the constituency I am not exaggerating. Many people believe that those who left the firms at that time are dispersed for good and will never return to the industry. Men of great skillâ€”technicians with great expertiseâ€”felt the wind of redundancy and, as a result, left the industry. I am sure that some of them are lost to steel for good. In July, 1963, the position was so acute that my predecessor and my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) led a delegation to Stewarts & Lloyds here in London and explained the seriousness of the situation. At that time they extractedâ€”I  think that ""extracted"" is the right word â€”recognition of the social consequences of this upheaval in the iron trade at Chesterfield. I do not think that any intelligent person would suggest that we had to keep open plants purely to keep men at work. If that were to be the case, it would be a negation of any economic principles. There were up-to-date capacity and up-to-date plant in Chesterfield at that time which were deliberately closed to serve the interests of boardroom decisions. Any person charged with taking a decision in an industrial concern such as steel has the duty of recognising what the social costs and the social benefits are. It is generally accepted that, if the iron and steel industry is to become more efficient, it will be on the basis of rationalisation and specialisation, but I think that that can be achieved without the troubles that we experienced in Chesterfield after 1960. There is evidence at present that large companies which have works in different parts of the country do not allocate their orders in any rational way. For instance, there is evidence that when companies tackle the fundamental issue of securing greater efficiency and greater rationalisation they reach the decisions without enough consultation. There may well be consultation at boardroom level, but too often workers are faced with a fait accompli, and at that time it is sometimes found, as was said in the House on Friday, that restrictive practices which I do not think are to the best interests of the industry are set up. This debate has generated a lot of heat, and by 10 o'clock tonight it will have generated much more heat. No matter what decision is taken tonight and no matter what decisions are taken in this Parliament, iron and steel will be facing tremendous problems. They will be facing changes in techniques and changes in structure. I am saying the obvious but I think that these will have profound effects on the ordinary man. I know from first-hand experience, after living in Chesterfield all my life, of the anxieties felt during the period of which I have spoken. There will be changes in iron and steel but we have to start from the standpoint of seeing how far we can have the consultations and discussions which are absolutely necessary and seeing how far we   can look to the well-being of the people employed in the industry rather than at any other factor. If we do this we shall have the co-operation of the workers and their assistance in these changes.
