It gives me great pleasure to make my maiden speech in this honourable House. I represent a very small constituency in that great cosmopolitan conurbation of London, and I am taking the place of five predecessors who, I am sure, were well known to many hon. Members. The first was Viscount Curzon; the next was William Bennett; the next was Harry Selley, later Sir Harry; the next was Mrs. Ganley; and the next was my immediate predecessor, Mr. Ernest Partridge. My arrival on this side of the House makes it all square; it makes it three of each. I consider it an honour this afternoon to deal with the problems of Battersea in general and Battersea, South, in particular. There is not much difference between Battersea, North and Battersea, South. My right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) knows that the line of demarcation between the constituencies has been changed twice since he became a Member of this honourable House. The change gave him an increased majority, but it made my constituency a marginal seat. The line of demarcation has been determined by railway lines which have changed in the last 12 years. If it were the Victoria line it made one seat a marginal seat. If it were changed to the Waterloo line it made the other seat a marginal seat. As a result, we have had these disturbances. But to the people in the area, Battersea is one entity. Last week this House intended to celebrate its 700th anniversary. Unfortunately, owing to the demise of one of our great statesmen we could not do this. But two years ago Battersea celebrated its 700th year of recorded Church history. Thus, its history goes back to the time before this House; it has a recorded history of over 700 years. During the reign of William the Conqueror it was given by him to the Abbey of Westminster. It has been a thriving community for over 700 years. The point which I wish to make is that despite the long history of Battersea, the  former Minister of Housing and Local Government saw fit, in the reorganisation of London government, to do away with the name of Battersea. We accepted his desire to abolish the name ""Battersea"". An instruction was sent by his Ministry to local authorities in London to the effect that he did not want double-barrelled names. We did not like that, but we were prepared to put up with it. But within weeks he had given way to the constituency in London in which he lived. I refer to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. I have no quarrel with that, because I have many friends on both sides of the House who live in Chelsea. However, while he debarred any other authority in London from having a double-barrelled name, when it came to the constituency in which he lived he called it the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. I have no objection to the name ""Chelsea"", because Chelsea happened to beat West Ham last Saturday, but if Chelsea's name was good enough to be retained, we in Battersea felt that the name ""Battersea"" should have been retained. I speak for all the people in Battersea in this matter, irrespective of party and Church. We take a very poor view of the attitude adopted by the former Minister of Housing and Local Government, the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph). Battersea is a highly concentrated industrial area. It has wonderful firms in it like the Morgan Crucible Co. which has a tradition in export and production. We in Battersea are thankful that we have firms of such calibre, which do so much for the benefit of the country. We have a large amount of railway property, goods depots, power and gas stations, a heliport and numerous small industries like engineering and flour milling. We as a borough are to be absorbed by the Borough of Wandsworth. We feel that we have been sorely treated. It is proposed to move Covent Garden Market to the site of the Nine Elms Goods Depot. Personally, I think that that is a very good idea. Not everybody sees eye to eye with me, but I welcome it. This brings to light another fact of life in Battersea. Like many other areas in London, Battersea is built up. We have no room to spread and no land on which to build houses. In Battersea and   places like it there is plenty of surplus railway land lying idle and dormant which could be used for house and flat development. I suggest, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that this land should be used by local authorities in helping to solve their housing problems. We in Battersea object strongly to private schemes being arranged by the British Transport Commission to make this land available to investment companies for them to develop. If there is any surplus railway land in London, and in Battersea, in particular, we think that it should be used for housing. At one time much of the surplus railway land in Battersea was common land. Only a short time ago the Battersea Borough Council refused permission to develop to a firm by the name of Overline Investments and other firms in which Mr. Charles Clore was interested to develop the best site facing the river and Battersea Park. Negotiations had been going on for three years to erect luxury flats on this site without any consultation with the local borough council. Only when the question of planning permission arose did the council, of which I am a member, have any knowledge that the land was to be used for that purpose. As I say, if there is surplus railway land in Battersea, or in any other part of London, it should be sold to local authorities at a reasonable price for housing so that the very serious housing problem can be alleviated. Another thing which is worrying the people of Battersea is the suggested new roads which will run right through our new estates and the enormous shopping centre known as Clapham Junction. Clapham Junction is the heart of Battersea. It is, I suppose, the focal paint of railway organisation in the south of England. We read that a new road is to be built which may do away with this fine shopping centre. On behalf of the firms and traders in this area, I protest most strongly against the construction of arterial roads through the Borough of Battersea. I make these points on behalf of my constituents and the people of Battersea in general. They have something to do with the development of office accommodation and industrial accommodation. We want industrial development, but we  want it in the right places. We want office development, if necessary, but it must be in the right places. I thank you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and the House, for giving me this opportunity to speak, but I cannot promise to be in future as non-controversial as I have been on this occasion.
