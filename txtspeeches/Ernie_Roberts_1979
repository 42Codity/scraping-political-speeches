The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West (Mr. Dodsworth) and the Chief Secretary put forward forthrightly and clearly a point of view on behalf of the people whom they represent. I hope to do the same in my first speech to the House. I start, however, by referring to David Weitzman who represented my constituency  for 34 years. During that time, he made hundreds of speeches, many of them on a Friday. He tells me that as a result of that he was known as ""Man Friday"". It is on the record that David Weitzman was spoken of highly by many Prime Ministers. He paid particular attention to industrial and compensation cases on behalf of those he represented. The fact that he was a QC helped considerably in those matters. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) will remember that he was assisted by David Weitzman in pushing through the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. I am sure that we all wish David Weitzman a happy and healthy retirement. My constituency suffers badly as a result of the anarchic, jungle-like character of the society in which we liveâ€”a society which the Conservatives call a free society. One of their forefathers, Disraeli, referred to the divided society of two nations, the nation of the ""haves"" and the nation of the ""have nots"". The Finance Bill does nothing to lessen the differences between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"". In fact, it fastens the shackles of poverty and deprivation more firmly on the legs of my constituents. The new VAT rate of 15 per cent., which has been given much attention because of its serious implications, will further depress living standards and raise inflation, as the Government admit, to 17 Â½ per cent. and, it is thought, even higher by the end of the year. That will cause further problems for the working people whom I represent. Unemployment, which is bad enough already, is projected by the Treasury to rise to 2 millionâ€”though it would be seen, if the true figures were included in the official statistics, to be close to that now. The 30 per cent. base rate of income tax will be of no help to the numerous low-paid workers in my constituency. Furthermore, the increase for old-age pensioners in November will be insufficient against the rise in VAT to 15 per cent., the 60 per cent. petrol tax and the rising prices which will result from the policies embodied in the Bill. This Tory Finance Bill will produce a further deplorable shift in wealth and   power in the interest of the ""haves"". To quote those well known wordsâ€” For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. The Finance Bill will reduce direct taxation by some Â£4,540 million, helping those who least need to be helped, but it will increase, through indirect tax levies of some Â£4,700 million the burden on the backs of consumers. The terminological inexactitudesâ€”hon. Members have heard that expression beforeâ€”and statistical fantasies of the Chancellor are no answer to the real experiences of working people under the burden of indirect taxation and what it will mean to them in lowered living standards. My constituency exemplifies working-class poverty, with 5,000 one-parent families, 1,000 children in care, 11,000 homeless, the largest percentage of low-paid workers in London, the highest infant mortality rate in Britain at 20Â·7 per 1,000, above average unemployment and a lack of investment by free enterprise capital. But that poverty is even more glaring when set against the fact that we are adjacent to the constituency of City of London and Westminister, South, with its joint stock banks, the Stock Exchangeâ€”already referred to by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South-West and the Chief Secretaryâ€”Lloyd's, the commodity markets, and, of course, the Royal Exchange, over whose portico are inscribed the words: The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. I am sure that there are many noble Members in the other House who would say ""Amen"" to that. When the Tory victory in the general election was announced, we heard that share values went up by some Â£2,000 million. I immediately thought, as many workers did: If people in the Stock Exchange can produce wealth so easily, so massively and so quickly, why do we not build more stock exchanges? This is a rich country, a country with skilled workers, scientists and technicians, with coal, oil and gas and with its agricultureâ€”a veritable jewel set in a silver seaâ€”the second biggest investor abroad, second only to the United States of  America, and with a GNP running at this moment at about Â£150,000 million. The national cake is big, but still it is only the crumbs from the rich man's table which fall into the pockets of our working people. This Finance Bill defends that state of affairs. The question is not just the size of the cake but who owns the bakery. That is the problem which has to be solved before economic justice can be met in this country. Since coming into the House, I have heard the Prime Minister and the Chancellor say repeatedly that they want to put more in the taxpayer's pocket. Quite soâ€”but which taxpayer? I shall give the facts of life as they affect the so-called average family on Â£100 a week. In passing, I remind hon. Members that they will have read in the press yesterday and today that consideration is being given to the very modest demand for a base rate of Â£80 a week now being made by the engineers, of whom I have been one. That modest demand is being denied to them, yet we talk of the average family on Â£100 a week. The average family on Â£100 a week will get 4 per cent. more as a result of the tax cuts, so it is said, but they will certainly pay more because of the new rate of VAT. Moreover, every item in that family's shopping list contains a hidden element of tax. I have been looking into the figures and I wish to use the Department of Employment's family expenditure survey as a basis for calculation. The Government's proposed tax changes, including the 30 per cent. standard rate and all the elements of indirect taxation, will take from the so-called average Â£100-a-week man 45 per cent. of his wages, leaving him about Â£5Â·50 a week worse off. Even after account is taken of the Â£4 standard rate tax reduction, he will be worse off by Â£1Â·50 a week. On the other hand, the high-income family paying the new maximum rate of tax at 60 per cent., and no longer paying the investment income surcharge of 15 per cent., will end up with an extra 40 per cent. in their pocket. This shows once more who will gain most from the Tory Government's Budget and their so-called free economy. The Tory theories of the free economy and of monetarism are quite well   described by a Professor Mises. He talks of a person going to the market, and with every Â£1 he wants to spend casting his vote for what he wants to be produced. That, Professor Mises says, is democracy, forgetting that the worker goes to the market with tens of votes while the rich man goes to that same market with hundreds of thousands of votes. What economic democracy is there in that? For 20 years I have been a national trade union officer in engineering. I have sat across the negotiating table, as my engineering trade union colleagues have been doing during the past few months fighting for their Â£80 basic rate. I have faced the hard-headed businessmen on the other side keeping a hold on what the workers have earned for them and refusing to make concessions. Now, across this carpeted divide, we see what to me represents the executive of big business. Over this new negotiating table, the Floor of the House, my aim is the same as it was in the pastâ€”to fight for a just share of the wealth of this nation on behalf of those who created it. This Tory Finance Bill does nothing to bring about that end.
