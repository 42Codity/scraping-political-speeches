This is the first time I have had the honour to address the House. I therefore crave the indulgence usually accorded to a maiden speaker. I also crave forgiveness for speaking while suffering from a cold in the head. I ask to be forgiven because I regard this subject as of the greatest importance and as completely free from controversy. This is a long and obscure Bill and, as the hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Miss Herbison) said, it may contain in its body bones of contention. But these are matters to be dealt with in Committee and do not affect the principle of the Bill, which is completely free from controversy. Stripped of all its verbiage and administrative detail, the Bill does two things. First, it sweeps away a mass of ancient legislation dating back to 1811 and substitutes new thinking, new ideas and a completely new approach to mental health. It is very difficult for the public to understand exactly what that new approach is. I confess that, until very recently, I had very little idea myself of what modern methods of treatment and modern drugs can do for mental illness. It is now recognised that mental pain is very largely a cause of mental disease. Mental pain can be as real as the pain of childbirth or the pain of appendicitis. When a woman is to have a baby, she consults her doctor. The doctor calls in the specialist and, ultimately, without formality, the woman goes to a nursing home, has her baby, returns home and is happy. If a person is suffering from appendicitis, he consults his doctor, he goes into the nursing home without formality, has the pain removed, and goes home happy. Up to now, however, if a person has been suffering mental anguish as real as any physical pain he has either had to be certified and taken away or he has had to sign a formal document to say that he is mad and wants to be detained. That is old-fashioned thinking. It is what we have had for the last hundred years. The position is now completely different, and the Bill asks that that person should be in the same position as anyone suffering from any physical illness. As my right hon. Friend has said, the kernel of the Bill is in Clause 23, which provides that any person in need of medical treatment for mental disease may be treated in a hospital or a nursing home without any formality whatever. That is the whole spirit of the Bill. We should all support it and make sure, too, that the public understand the position. Perhaps I can best illustrate my point by telling the House what is happening at Kingseat Hospital in my constituency. It has 750 beds and, although it may seem incredible, 550 people go into it each year and almost as many come out of it cured. That is a tremendous proportion of success. I had no idea of the magnitude of the success in such hospitals until I looked into the facts relating to this one. I should like to give an example. A woman had been looking after her old mother for many years. The mother was querulous and difficult. The girl had a tremendous sense of duty and, instead of looking after her own interests and going out with boys and girls of her own generation, she looked after her mother. If she felt inclined to go out, she would ask her mother if she could do so, and the mother would say, in the difficult way that some old people do, ""Of course you can go out. I won't really have a heart attack while you are out of the house."" Many a time, the wretched girl thought in her inmost mind that it would be a good thing if her mother died. When the old lady died from purely natural causesâ€”heart failureâ€”the girl got into a panic. She suffered unbearable anguish and felt that the only way to atone for her wicked thoughts was to commit suicide. She tried several times to commit suicide and had ultimately to be certified. By means of psychiatric treatment and modern drugs she was cured in a very short time and once more given a proper sense of perspective. All this happened many years ago. That woman now has a husband and a family and is a useful and happy citizen because of her treatment but the House must remember that she was a certified patient. Last week, I saw a boy who had committed a petty misdemeanour. That had prayed on his mind so much that he was under the delusion that he was dead and in hell, and he suffered all the agonies of hell. Ten days after his admission, that boy found it almost impossible to believe that he had been under that delusion. In a week or two he will be back at work, a perfectly useful citizen. If the success at Kingseat Hospital is multiplied by that achieved in all the specialist hospitals, the value of the work will be seen to be beyond estimation. The unfortunate fact is that both the woman and the boy to whom I have just referred were certified cases. There is no doubt that a hundred years ago they would have been in padded cells, and would not have been cured. Similar patients are being treated and cured but have to undergo all the indignity of either certification or the signing of an admission that they are mad and want to be detained. The Bill seeks to sweep all that away. I beg the House to give it an unopposed Second Reading and to leave discussion of the administrative details until later. Finally, I should like to pay a tribute to the doctors and nurses who are making all this possible. I am sorry to say that they are at present the poor relations of their profession, and only the education of the public will end that. In Kingseat Hospital, the physician superintendent, Dr. Stewart, is carrying on work started by his father, and he has produced this tremendous success. The matron, Miss Cooper, is a devoted and dedicated woman. As an attractive girl of 16 or 17 years of age she trained as a secretary and discovered, quite by accident, how mental cases were treated. She was quite certain that she knew how to treat them, and had the patience, the skill and the devotion to give up everything for this work. She is now running that hospital, handling a devoted staff, and producing these great results. It is proper that I should say that so that the public should know the sort of thing that goes on. The public and we as their representatives should give the doctors and nurses all the support possible in their work. I ask the House, I implore the House, to give the Bill an undivided Second Reading.
