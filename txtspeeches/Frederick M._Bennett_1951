May I commence by making the formal and general plea for the indulgence which is always granted by this generous House to a maiden speaker? It is perhaps a little   ironical that for the last two years before the General Election I occupied another seat in this Houseâ€”with the Fourth Estate above; when it was my job to write on foreign affairs and also to criticise Members' speeches on those topics. I have already discovered, in a fortnight, that criticism is a good deal easier than performance. However, if I have already learnt anything about maiden speeches it is that to meet the favour of the House they should first, and above all, be brief; second, should be non-controversial, and third, if possible should reveal some factual knowledge of the subject chosen by the maiden speaker. It is for that reason that I should like, this evening, to follow the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom (Mr. McCorquodale) in talking about Egypt's pretences to rule the Sudan. Some three years ago I had an opportunity to tour the Sudan fairly extensively, from the extreme south, bordering on Uganda; down the Nile valley and up to the Egyptian border. During that tour I also visited Khartoum and met some of the local political leaders there, and afterwards I went to Omdurman. If I might digress for a moment, I should like to recall that at the battle of that name, half-a-century ago, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and my father, who was for so many years a Member of this House himself, were comrades in arms and saw the downfall of the Dervish army which preceded the 1899 Condominium Agreement. After I had left the Sudan I went on to Cairo, where I had the additional advantage of a long interview with Nahas Pasha, at that time the leader of the Opposition and now, as hon. Members know, the Prime Minister. On that occasion I first heard expounded the twin Egyptian claimsâ€”one for the immediate expulsion of all British Forces from the Canal Zone, and the other a demand for Egyptian sovereignty over the whole of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. I had the temerity at the close of those remarks to say these words, ""Your Excellency, Egypt really cannot have it both ways."" By that, I meant that I had heard a strong exposition against Britain for not leaving the Canal Zone. We were accused of being imperialists and relying on past conquests to maintain our position thereâ€”an accusation which, incidentally, ignored altogether our rights under the  1936 Treaty. While, on the one hand, the Egyptian argument is that we are imperialists and that we rely on past conquests for our position, on the other hand, in almost the same breath they turn round and claim that, because of marauding levies of Egyptians, sent southwards on slave raiding and other activities in the 19th century, occupied by force the whole of the Sudan and gave a briefâ€”a happily briefâ€”period of extremely unenlightened rule to that region, they have the right to remain there indefinitely as rulers. They claim that that fact alone gives them the power and the justice to continue to rule that area. But there is a second argument which I have heard put forward to justify these aspirations to rule the Sudan. They say that the needs of their national security for them to control the upper waters of the Nile over-ride all other considerations. There again, I think, one can say that Egypt cannot have it both ways, because if the needs of their national security' over-ride all other considerations of justice or anything else, then the same fact must apply to Britain's needs of national security in the Canal Zoneâ€”her need there for Commonwealth security. If this Egyptian argument is still being propounded it would seem to justify our remaining indefinitely in the Canal Zone even when the 1936 Treaty terms are ended in 1956. When, in both these arguments on national security and past conquests, the contradictions are pointed out to Egyptians, I have found that a further argument is advancedâ€”one which is no less fallacious. That is what I call, ""The Sudanese are our brothers"" claim. In other words, it is a claim that the King of the Egyptians and the Egyptian Government should rule the Sudan because of racial affinity. That is just as fallacious as the other arguments, both historically and ethnologically, because if we consider the Sudan as an entity we must consider not only the area of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan but the whole great land mass of Northern Central Africa, which stretches southwards from the Sahara to the Equator, from Massawa on the Red Sea across to Cape Verdi on the Atlantic. For the Egyptians to rely simply on the fact that in the northeastern provinces of this vast area there has been a great admixture of Arabic   and negroid blood, and to justify kingship over the whole of the Sudan, would be no more and no less fantastic, in my submission, than for King Farouk to claim to rule Uganda or Eritrea. In conclusion, I want to refer to the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom about the utter unreality of the proposed plebisciteâ€”proposed in certain circles in Paris at the moment. To anyone who has visited the Sudan even for a comparatively short time, and seen how the bulk of the inhabitants are still living in complete primitive savagery and almost complete illiteracy, the suggestion that a plebiscite, such as would be applicable to European countries, could suddenly be held there and could give a valid result is not only unreal but utterly unthinkable. I believe that the best and only solution for this problem, since the Egyptians have chosen to abrogate the Condominium, is for us to go forward with our own trusteeship for these people. It is only in that way, if we go on with the programme which, as has been generously said, belongs to all parties and to past Governments hereâ€”the programme of continuing to develop the social and economic potentialities of the Sudanese so that a constitutional framework may, in due courseâ€”not too long, I hopeâ€”be built up. It is only when that is done that the Sudanese will be in a position to make a truly free and unfettered choice of their own future status in the world. They may have three choices before them. One that they may select is to have some form of federal union with Egypt. Another oneâ€”and one must see this possibilityâ€”is that of complete independence on the lines of Ethiopia. The thirdâ€”and this is the one that, frankly, I hope will be chosenâ€”is that of self-government within the British Commonwealth.
