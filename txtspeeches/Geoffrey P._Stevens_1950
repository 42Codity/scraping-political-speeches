Ever since the House assembled in March it has been depressing for me   to listen to maiden speech after maiden speech, each one an improvement on its predecessorâ€”something which the excellence of the first maiden speech had made me feel was impossible. That very high standard of speeches very understandably makes my task all the harder. This I have in common with my predecessors who have ""broken their duck ""â€”I shall be a very happy man when this ""maiden"" is safely delivered. I am very happy that the subject upon which I am to make my first venture in this Chamber is housing, for it is a subject which is very close to my heart, as it is to the hearts of thousands of people who live in Portsmouth, many of whom I am proud to represent. All of us receive letters in which our constituents put problems to us and we also of course make ourselves available to our constituents for them to bring their problems to us. I do not know whether this is general or whether it is particular to my division, but the problems that are so brought can be divided into approximately two equal categories. Fifty per cent. of the problems are connected with housing and the other 50 per cent. covers the rest of the subjects. The housing problem in Portsmouth is particularly severe because Portsmouth was one of the six worst blitzed cities in the United Kingdom. I am well aware that, as has been pointed out earlier, the lists of those who are waiting for houses is not an exact measure of the housing problem. Part of an article which I read in yesterday's ""News of the World"" seemed to indicate that someone else in this Committee shares that view, but it can at least be said that the waiting list for houses forms a very useful approximate yardstick of the problem. In Portsmouth 7,513 families were waiting for houses in March, 1948â€”families, not persons; a family may be two, three or four or more persons. In March, 1949, there were 9,636 families on the waiting list and in March, 1950, there were 10,445. In other words, the position had worsened by 40 per cent. in two years. The houses under contract or to be contracted for in 1950, not all of which will be completed this year, total 1,000 or less than one-tenth of the present need. That is a deplorable testimony to the inadequacy of the building programme. Three reasons are normally advanced, two of which have been advanced this  afternoon, as to why it is not possible to improve on the number of houses to be built. One point which has not so far been made this afternoon is that councils have not in all cases built up to the permitted limits. The second point, which has been made several times today, is that the building force is fully employed. The third reason refers to the limit of the capital investment programme. It is perfectly true that all councils have not built up to their permitted limits, but that is only a half truth because it entirely ignores the financial limitations under which the local authority is working, such as the questions of the amortisation of the necessary loans, the interest on those loans and the extension of the necessary services. There is in the case of the blitzed cities, the special problem of the difficulty of obtaining suitable sites for development. In that respect there are in Portsmouthâ€”I imagine it is not peculiar to Portsmouthâ€”a large number of sites suitable for the development of one or two houses. These are very suitable for development by the private speculative builder but are entirely uneconomic for development by the local authority. I hope that in considering Portsmouth, the Minister of Health will generously interpret his allocation of private licences whether or not there may be differences of opinion as to the purpose which these private licences are to serve. Secondly, the building labour force. We on this side of the Committee have often said that not everyone in this country is pulling his full weight; and we have been accused of slandering the working classes. What we have said and meant is that the majority of people are doing a fine job. But there is an important percentageâ€”it may be 6 per cent., or 8 per cent. or some other percentageâ€”who are doing no more than they are forced to do, and therefore are depriving us of that marginal productivity which would not only build more houses, but would cheapen houses. Incidentally, applied to industry overall, they are depriving us of that marginal productivity, the achievement of which would banish inflation. I suggest that paragraph 41 of this Working Party Report justifies that statement up to the hilt. Paragraph 41 contains these words, which I take from the context, though I do not alter their meaning:   â€¦ by the end of 1948, for the building industry as a whole, productive efficiency was about three-quarters of its pre-war level. It is perfectly true that the paragraph goes on: Towards the end of 1949 it appears to have been running several points higher, and on average productive efficiency during 1949 seems to show an improvement on the 1948 figure. and as I see it, well it might. A suggestion has been made this afternoon that this refers not so much to labour as to organisation and materials. I saw in the ""Daily Herald"" this morning reference to the Ministry of Health Report which was published this morning, and I quote again from that paper: The number of man hours for a given type of house is still 26 per cent. above pre-war. It seems very clear to me that if the building labour force, broadly speaking, is wholly at work, and not all of them are hard at work, there is considerable scope by the expansion of incentives schemes for an improvement in productivity. That will not be without effect upon the third point raised against us, which is the capital investment programme. We have been told this afternoon, and on other occasions, that we can have more houses only at the expense of factories, or schools, or perhaps I suppose of Government offices. I believe that in the present deplorable conditions housing has an overwhelming priority. I rate the need of a happy environment, especially with children, above almost anything else. I think it true to say that it was the realisation of that before the war, by a Government of whose political complexion I suppose I should not hint atâ€”since I am sheltering under the maidenly umbrellaâ€”which led them to bring into operation the largest programme of house building and slum clearance that this country has ever known. I did say of house production and not wigwam production. I believe that a Chancellor with practical financial experience could so arrange the capital investment programme as to increase the housing programme not merely without dire consequences to our economy, but with the greatest possible assistance to it. I would make a special plea for the blitzed cities of which, as I have said, Portsmouth is one of the six worst.  Theirs is a special problem so far as finance is concerned. The provision for an Exchequer equalisation grant under the Local Government Act, 1948, does not always work out fairly for them. The exodus of a large number of the pre-war population of Portsmouth, largely owing to bomb damage, has had the effect that the rateable value per head of the population has gone above the datum line for the country as a whole, and Portsmouth does not qualify for the Exchequer equalisation grant. It is true that some consideration has been given to this entirely unrealistic result, but the help which is being given in on a diminishing scale and comes to an end in 1951. We have been told it is the end, but I hope it is not regarded as the last word. I hope that, though the door may be closed, it is not altogether bolted. This Working Party report is addressed to the Minister of Works, and like other hon. Members on this side of the Committee, I wish the right hon. Gentleman well. I look forward to great success from him in a realm in which the Minister of Healthâ€”if I may say so in an entirely cordial and non-controversial spiritâ€”has been so dismal and tragic a failure.
