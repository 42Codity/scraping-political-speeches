In rising to make my maiden speech on this tiny Bill and at this time I am conscious of squeezing myself into a rather restricted space in terms both of order and of time. That is probably no bad thing from the point of view of the rest of the House. As Member for Islington, South-West, I succeed Mr. Albert Evans, who represented that and his preceding Islington constituency for close on a quarter of a century. Older Members will recall the effectiveness of his interventions, particularly on the subject of housing, which is a major question in my constituency. I am sure that they will join me in wishing Mr. Evans well in his retirement. Before coming to the House I had spent the greater part of my previous career as a civil servant. I mention that to form a peg on which to hang a plea for the improvement of Governmental habits by a breakdown in the apartheidâ€”there is no other wordâ€”which exists between civil servants and politicians. There is a feeling among some civil servants that there is a great divide between that form of human being which is a politician and that form which exists in Whitehall. This feeling does not exist in many other countries and is a weakness in our system. We could do with more contact outside office hours between these two forms of people who are both deeply concerned in the one business, that of government.
