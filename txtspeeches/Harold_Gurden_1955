Several things which I think are of importance to all of us have emerged from this debate. One thing I particularly noticed is that hon. Members oppositeâ€”some of them at any rateâ€”have shown very clearly that, in spite of the last Election, they are still in favour of nationalisation. I do not know what the modern term is, whether it is tiddly-winks or Rugger, but I think hon. Members opposite ought to remember that there was a General Election and that the main body of the public certainly told us they did not want any more nationalisation.
