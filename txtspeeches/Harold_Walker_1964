The right hon. Member for Wallasey (Mr. Marples) said that he was making his maiden speech at the Opposition Dispatch Box. My remarks will be more virginal. In making my maiden speech, I ask the House to extend to me the courtesy which it has shown to many of my hon. Friends since the Gracious Speech. I am conscious that I follow in the footsteps of many distinguished predecessors. If I make only a brief reference to my most immediate oneâ€”the former Minister of Healthâ€”it is not out of any churlishness but in anticipation of possible future political events. I have in mind, too, his own predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour, so it is clear that I have been set some very high standards, which I must attempt to live up to. The constituency which I represent is situated in the heart of south Yorkshire. When the right hon. Member for Wallasey was speaking about the attitude of my colleagues in the trade union movement there came into my mind immediately a picture of the miners who had moved to that area from Durham and Scotland as a result of the technological changes that had taken place in the mining industryâ€”changes which were warmly welcomed, no doubt as a result of the change in ownership, leadership and compassionate understanding which was extended to their problems.  That was in stark contrast to my experience as a manual worker coming directly from private industry into the House. My constituency is concerned with much more than coal mining. It is perhaps most famous, among its many reasons for being celebrated, for its horse racing and its railways. The behaviour of the trains is much more predictable than that of the horses.
