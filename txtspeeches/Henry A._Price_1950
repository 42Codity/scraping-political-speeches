The Debate we have been listening to today has been on the Working Party Report on the Building Industry. Emphasis has undoubtedly been on housing, and I am very glad it has been so. This is the first occasion on which I have addressed this Committee, and as a Member for one of the three constituencies of the Lewisham borough, which has a very serious problem indeed, I have always hoped that it would be upon an occasion when we would be discussing housing that I would first address the Committee. During the past 4Â½ years I have followed with interest the housing debates which have taken place in this Chamber.   During the past three months I have listened to them, and always I have found it impossible to believe that hon. Gentlemen opposite are as satisfied with the housing progress as they have seemed. I have not heard or seen anything during the past three months which has caused me to change my mind. If it were possible for a vote to be taken on what we all feel in our hearts, as distinct from what we say with our lips, the result would be condemnation of the Government's achievements, if they can so be called, during the past four and a half years. I cannot believe that any Member opposite is satisfied with the housing programme of 200,000 houses per annum. There is one hon. Member of the last Parliament who must be a very bitterly disappointed man. He is quoted by the Minister of Health in his book, ""Why not Trust the Tories?"" It so happens that not only was he a Member of the last Parliament, but he is a member of the Working Party which has just issued this Report. On page 77 of ""Why Not Trust the Tories?"" the right hon. Gentleman quotes him as saying Therefore, it is clear that if we have priority in organisation of materials and balanced distribution of labour we can produce with the same amount of labour as pre-war, if it is properly co-ordinated, half a million houses per year. That is why I say that that Member must be a bitterly disappointed man. Why are we not building half a million houses per year? Have we not had priority in organisation of materials, and if not why not? Whose fault is it? Have we not had balanced distribution of labour, and if not why not? Whose fault is that? Have we not had proper co-ordination, and again if not why not? Whose fault is that? Is it because these have been absent that we have to be satisfied with only 200,000 houses per year? It has become customary for hon. Gentlemen opposite to defend themselves by a comparison with the achievements of the Government in office after the 1914â€“18 war. There are many lessons to be learnt from those periods. I have learned one lesson by reading the Holmes Report, issued in 1921. Mistakes were made during the years after the first war, and one of those mistakes was allowing the demand to outrun the capacity of the industry. That mistake was pinpointed in  the White Paper of 1945, which was prepared by the Coalition Government, of which the Minister of Works was so contemptuous this afternoon. Paragraph 13 reads: Only completed houses are of immediate service in relieving the housing shortage. As experience after the last war showed, a programme beyond the capacity of the building industry would have the result that many houses would be started but few completed. Moreover, there would be a powerful pressure on prices if, in the early stages, more work were offered than the building industry could perform. That is one pitfall into which the Government fell after the last war and, though it was clearly marked by the foresight of the Coalition Government in 1945, it has not been avoided by the administration which has been in power since then. The Working Party Report, following the Girdwood Report of two years ago, deals with many other mistakes, and most of them have been referred to today. It would be impossible for me, in the few minutes at my disposal, to go into much detail, but there are one or two points I must make. Again I must refer to ""Why not Trust the Tories?"" I refer to this because it was written by the Minister of Health at a time when, in my opinion, he would have been better occupied in other ways. He says on page 75: Even before the war we needed a replacement programme of 200,000 houses a year. Surely today after five years of war and five years of Socialist misrule, we need a bigger replacement programme than that. However, let us take the Minister's figure of replacements of 200,000 houses per year. That is what we are getting today. If the Minister's figure is correctâ€”and surely I cannot be criticised for taking the Minister's own figureâ€”all we are doing today is to replace those houses which fall into disuse as a result of age, insanitary conditions or because they are dangerous structures. In other words, we are not increasing the total number of of units available. It may well be that this is one of the reasons why, despite our efforts, the housing lists continue to get longer and longer. In the same book the right hon. Gentleman says this: Even to climb back to the housing position we had reached before the warâ€”and you know how far from satisfactory that wasâ€”   we require a minimum of four million new houses. Many targets have been quoted, but surely I cannot be criticised for taking the right hon. Gentleman's own target of four million new houses. How long is it going to take to reach that target at the present rate of progress? Even if we forget replacement needs, according to my figures, giving the Government credit for 157,000 temporary houses, which the right hon. Gentleman in the same book so contemptuously describes as ""steel boxes,"" it is going to take 25 years, that is if we ignore replacement needs, but we cannot ignore replacement needs. Recrimination is only useful in so far as it points to the mistakes of the past and encourages us to avoid them in the future. I pray that the mistakes which have been pointed out in the Girdwood Report and again in the Working Party Report will point the way for the right hon. Gentleman in the future, but I am not very optimistic about it. My impression is that he is far too wedded to Socialist theory to adopt policies which are essentially of a Tory character. The release of controls, for example, which, according to the Girdwood Report, have added Â£70 to the cost of an average local authority house is one example which comes readily to mind. In my effort to look for constructive suggestions I have confined myself to those which I think even the right hon. Gentleman could quite well adopt. They are three in number. One of the greatest problems we have to face in dealing with houses today is rising costs. The Government's ceiling is not a numerical but a financial ceiling, and if it were possible to bring down costs we could increase the total number of houses built without increasing the demands upon the capital resources of the nation. Another aspect is one which touches mostly those people who need houses, and that is the manner in which those costs are reflected in rents, and in that respect the situation is much more serious than is pictured in the Girdwood and the Working Party Reports. These emphasise the cost and the rents chargeable on a typical three-bedroomed cottage. In the part of the world from which I come, Lewisham, there are very few cottages. Most of the new housing units are flats, and the story there is very  much grimmer than the story we read here. I would like to quote two examples of this from the Lewisham Borough Council. The council are now offering flats which have been built as the result of a scheme started by the previous council. One flat was offered only a week or two ago to a Post Office worker. His wage was just over Â£6 but the rent of the flat was about Â£2 10s. a week, despite the subsidy. There is an even better example of this on a larger housing scheme known as the Hether Grove Estate. The rents here are 36s. a week, and for a four-bedroomed flat 39s., despite a subsidy of about 27s. per week. The result was that of the first 80 people to whom these flats were offered more than 40 had to refuse them because they could not afford to pay the rent. The flats had to be let to families a little lower down the list whose need was not so great but whose pockets were a little deeper. If the Tories were sitting on the Government side of the House that would be described as ""housing by the purse."" It is happening today under a Socialist Government and under a Socialist L.C.C. That issue alone will kill the Government in course of time. What are we going to do about it? What about the long-term problem which also bothers me? What are Lewisham Borough Council, and other councils who are in the same position, going to do with those flats, in 10, 15 or 20 years' time when it is hoped that costs will be reduced? They will either be empty because they cannot be let at the high rents, or else the rents will have to be reduced, thus casting additional burdens upon the ratepayers. I would like to make two suggestions, or one suggestion divided into two, for the consideration of the Minister. The first suggestion is that the rate of interest on public works loans should be reduced by half per cent. The second suggestion is that the repayment period might be lengthened from 60 years to anything up to 80 years. I have had the figures worked out and I find that the half per cent. decrease in interest, added to an increase of 20 years in repayment, would reduce the rents by more than 5s. per week. That may not sound very much, but we must remember that lots of tenants of these flats are living on the borderline and are only just making both   ends meet. To them the 5s. is worth thinking about. The next point, again a local authority point, is that the machinery through which local authorities have to pass before they can commence work on a housing scheme is too cumbersome. The Lord President of the Council made what I thought was a very unfair point during his Election broadcast. He said that since the Conservatives had taken over Lewisham Borough Council nine months previously he had not noticed any decrease in the number of letters he was receiving. The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that it is impossible for any local authority in London, with the possible exception of the London County Council itself, to commence work on a scheme in anything less than 12 months from its first conception because of the machinery through which the scheme has to pass. The local authority has to submit the scheme to the London County Council for Stage I, which is planning approval, permission to use that piece of land for housing purposes. Stage II is approval of the layout. Stage III is approval of the working drawings. Each of those stages takes from six to eight weeks if there are no queries whatever, and nine times out of ten there are queries. Having received approval at Stage III the authority can go out to tender. They then go to the L.C.C. for loan sanction, which means another six to eight weeks' delay if there are no queries, and there almost always are. Then they go to the Public Works Loans Board to get their money. If they are lucky they can start work within 12 months. Time is money. If it were possible to reduce this time factor, as I believe it is, I am sure we could reduce the cost of these schemes. We could at least reduce administrative costs in the town halls and at County Hall. I believe that Stage I could be cut out. Borough councils in London are quite capable of being their own town planning authorities. I believe that Stage II could be cut out. Let Stage III stay as it is. I do not see why the London County Council should not retain approval for Stage III, since they administer the London Building Acts and are the Fire Authority, but I do not see why the borough council should have to go to the L.C.C. for loan sanction, as if the basis of loan sanction were some  secret formula of the Ministry of Health. Why should not Lewisham Borough Council be given this formula? We have an excellent borough treasurer who is quite as capable of working out the formula as any official at County Hall. All he has to do is to make sure that the cost falls within the Ministry's ceiling. He can do that quite as well as the L.C.C. If these suggestions could be adopted I see no reason why the waiting period of 12 months should not be cut to anything between three and six months with advantage to all concerned. The last point concerns research. I am very pleased to see that this matter is emphasised in the Report of the Working Party and in the Girdwood Report published today. There is great need for research and for economy in the use of raw materials. I will not bore the Committee by going into details but I would mention briefly one example of what I have in mind. It has been proved that it is possible by using up-to-date techniquesâ€”I hope this point will be of special interest to the Minister of Worksâ€”to save up to 25 per cent. of the cement which is used today. I shall be very happy to pass on all the information I have on this point to the right hon. Gentleman. The Road Research Association know all about it. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have been approached. So far as I knowâ€”and I apologise to the Department if I am wrongâ€”they have not showed any very great interest in the fact that it is possible to save by economies anything up to 25 per cent. in the amount of cement which is being used in concrete today. Even if we assume that 25 per cent. is too great and we take 12Â½ per cent., it means there is a possibility of saving a million tons of cement per year and that would be a very substantial economy as well as saving a very substantial sum of money and releasing the cement for other purposes. That cement could be used, again by the employment of up-to-date techniques, for floors instead of timber. I understand that one of the chief handicaps in the erection of houses is the shortage of timber. Again, I shall be very glad to give the right hon. Gentleman details of this matter rather than to bore the Committee with them now. I have finished my three constructive points. I hope that these, if no other   parts of my speech, will appeal to the Minister of Works and to the Minister of Health who is no longer with him on the Front Bench. I hope that they will be looked at, and that some advantage will result to those who need homes and to the local authorities who are trying to supply them, as well as to the Government themselves. If the last should prove to be the case, the Government are welcome to it.
