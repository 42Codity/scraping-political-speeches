Everybody happy? Welcome to Westminster. It has been a privilege to start work here and to represent the people of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill who have sent me here. I offer some sympathy to Phil Boswell, the man I have replaced, and to his staff. No doubt, Phil and his staff expected a longer time down here than they received. Politics can be risky, as many hon. Members in this House will know better than Mayâ€”sorry, I meant me. I follow the footsteps of many good people like â€œMr Coatbridgeâ€, the right hon. Tom Clarke, who served here for 33 years. I would also like to recognise another Lanarkshire man, the late Labour leader John Smith, who was the best Prime Minister we never had. However, the man I have come to follow was a working man who recognised that workers had no voice inside Parliament. This man was also Lanarkshire born and he gave birth to the Labour party. His name lives on today through the Keir Hardie Society, of which I am one of the founders. Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, along with the other communities I representâ€”Stepps, Moodiesburn, Glenboig, Bargeddie, Birkenshaw, Tannochside and Viewparkâ€”were once part of the industrial landscape of coal and steel, like many other communities. But sadly, that is all gone. What is left is not enough. We have poverty and not enough housing. Our generation of children today and tomorrow have no real vision. They are kept on low pay with zero-hours contracts and are told to be grateful if they have a job. There is no opportunity for a house, as they cannot afford it. Our society is failing them, and the gap between the rich and the poor widens every day. My day job was with Royal Mail Parcelforce, delivering and collecting parcels every day. It was also my privilege to represent my workmates from Glasgow Parcelforce, to whom I was grateful. I represented those workers as a trade union representative of the Communication Workers Union. To workers today, I recommend you join a trade union movementâ€”our strength is in unity. I represent the CWU, and I am proud to be part of the trade union movement. I will also declare an interest. Royal Mail was not for sale; it was stolen, and I aim to return this great public service to its rightful ownersâ€”the residents of the UK. Today, I can tell this House and the private profiteer hedge funders that I am coming to take back my sonsâ€™ and daughtersâ€™ money, stolen by people who have no interest in Royal Mail, other than the pounds for profit. I come here as a working man, just as proud as my father, Matt Gaffney, and my mother, Helen Gaffney, who both worked every day, and who will be watching on the telly back home in Uddingston to witness my moment. Love you both, and thank you! To all my family and friends who know me, I say enjoy this momentâ€”it is yours. My new job starts now. With the help of my familyâ€”Anne, Matthew, Christopher and Paulâ€”and the CWU, my feet will stay on the ground. I am here to represent all my constituents, and I will aim to change society for the better. There is enough wealth in this country to close the poverty gap and close down food banks. As we enter Brexit, we could build a new United Kingdomâ€”one  that cares for all walks of life, one that cares for humanity, and one that shows equality for all. No matter our race, colour, religion or sexuality, we are all equal, and everyone, from cradle to grave, deserves dignity and respect. I know I have finished, but I am going to make one more point. We have a motto in North Lanarkshire Trade Union Council: â€œThe past we inherit, the future we buildâ€, and this I will apply as I stand here for unemployed workers, disabled workers and taxpaying workers, of whom there are many more than the privileged few.
