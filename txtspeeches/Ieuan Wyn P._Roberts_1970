I am told that a speech need not be interminable to be immortal. I am happy to assure hon. Members that this maidenly performance has no ambition to be either. I shall take only as much of the House's time as will suffice to relate the Gracious Speech to my constituency of Conway, described by my predecessor, who ably represented the constituency from 1966, as one of the finest in the Kingdom. Indeed, for mountains of matchless calm, wooded vales fresh as the day they were created, and restful shores which have restored countless work-weary visitors from Lancashire and beyond, my constituency has no equal, as more than one hon. Member has assured me in the short time I have enjoyed the privileges of this House. Like most of North Wales, my constituency is full of poetry, and occasionally the poetry is peppered with politics, as when Shelley, on leaving London for North Wales, feared that his soul might soon forget the woe its fellows share"". My concern on the reverse journey from Wales to Westminster was much the same and I might well have pleaded with the poet Let me for ever be what I have been, But not for ever at my needy door Let misery linger speechless, pale and lean. Some of my constituents have been looking distinctly pale and lean in recent years. I refer particularly to the small business men and hoteliers in that part of my constituency, notably Llandudno, which is on the wrong side of the development area blanket and, therefore, not exonerated from S.E.T. I welcome the reference in the Gracious Speech to the reform and reduction of taxation and trust that some relief from this sative  tax will not be long in coming. Although we have a wealth of sunshine I fear that we belong to the category described in the Gracious Speech as the less prosperous areas"". Traditionally, I am bound to be non-controversial on this occasion, and I trust that hon. Members will not think that I press my advantage too far when I point out that part of my constituency is not only outside the Welsh development area but sandwiched between that area and the Merseyside development area. This places us at a unique disadvantage in attracting new industry. Pleasant as our sunshine is, and even the ""unfettered wind"" which Shelley relished, at least in his anticipation of his holiday, we cannot live on these blessings alone, as our unemployment figures indicate. We need light industry to support our tourist trade, and I am fully in accord with the Government's policy of stimulating growth in the less prosperous areas by increasing their economic attractions. The natural attractions of the North Wales coast would be greatly enhanced by a first-class road from Merseyside to Bangor, and I sincerely hope that I shall not, at the end of this Parliament, look back in Bangor at lack of progress in this vital connection. I hope, too, that our rail connection with my native island of Anglesey will be fully restored as soon as possible. The Gracious Speech makes reference to plans at a later stage for giving the Scottish people a greater say in their own affairs. The party of Government stated some time ago that Wales also has a proud and distinctive tradition and that the views of the Welsh people must also be represented strongly and democratically. The plans for Scotland will, of course, be closely, but, I hope, not jealously, studied in Wales, for any effort in self-government is bound to be fraught with difficulty, and I hope that, when those plans are revealed, our people in Wales will wait and see before jumping to the conclusion that what is good enough for Scotland is good enough for our old and haughty nation, proud in arms as Milton described us. Like the majority of people in the Principality I would wish any step taken in the direction of self-government for   Wales to be a right and timely development of the devolutionary measures which have been taken during the last two decades. I would also wish any such step to be motivated entirely by a desire for our better government. There is no doubt in my mind that in Wales priority must be given to measures of reform in local government, and as such reforms will, we are promised, be associated with a general devolution of power from central Government, we may hope that the people of the Principality will shortly feel that they, too, have a greater voice in the conduct of their affairs. For this is the nub of the matter: government now touches the people closely, perhaps too closely for comfort, and there is a general desire that those responsible for government should be near to the people they govern. There is one other matter in the Gracious Speech to which I crave the indulgence of hon. Members to refer, rather belatedly. That is the fresh emphasis given to Britain's international interests, the maintenance of peace and the promotion of prosperity. These interests are traditionally very close to the hearts of our Welsh nation. The younger generation particularly regards the world rather than Britain as its oyster, and in its own way this generation is more imperially minded in the best sense than those which preceded it. Its genuine concern for other peoples and its belief that Britain should do right by those peoples augur well for Britain's future in the world. I have never believed that Britain has yet to find a rÃ´le in world affairs. There is always a rÃ´le for a country that dedicates itself to the maintenance of peace and the promotion of world prosperity. If we pursue these objectives honestly and realistically, as I am sure the Government will, leaving to others the perfidious rÃ´le, we shall achieve the ""unity within"" spoken of by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and attain the greater respect we all wish for Britain in the world at large.
