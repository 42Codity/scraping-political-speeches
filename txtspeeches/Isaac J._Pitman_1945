I ask three favours. First, that this House should continue to extend the old tradition of sympathy and forbearance to an anxious and inexperienced speaker. Secondly, I ask for an ancient ally of this House in the cause of freedom, a specially friendly spirit. The Bank was founded in 1694, only six years after the great revolution of 1688, and it played, as an ally of this House, a most important part in maintaining those freedoms. I am sure the Chancellor will agree with me when I ask that we should not only for historical reasons give them that spirit of sympathy and forbearance, but also for party reasons, particularly when I say that the Bank of England was formed to keep the Tories out of power. Seriously, the Bank of England is a very precious institution, not only in this country but in the world   and, as I say, I think the Chancellor will agree that we ought to bring a spirit of moderation and a true spirit of objectivity to our deliberations this afternoon. Credit is popularly supposed to be wholly monetary. Believe me, it is at least as much, in fact probably more, emotional. I hope, therefore, that we shall be at great pains to keep emotion down and bring objectivity and sincerity to bear. The third favour I would ask is the indulgence of this House in that I am still a stockholder, and was, until 2nd August, a director of the Bank of England. I could have sold my qualifying stockholding but I had confidence in the general fairness of the British people and of this House in particular. I decided to show that confidence by holding it, and I hope that it will not be counted against me that I had that confidence and that I have to avow this interest, and to ask hon. Members to continue their usual courtesy of listening. I would like to take the opportunity first of saying that, as a stockholder, I regard the compensation as eminently fair. I say that not only as a stockholder, but as a taxpayer and a citizen. However, I speak as a mere mortal. It is different for an undying corporation like King William's Compatriots, the University Professors of Utrecht University or his new subjects, the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, who were among the original Venturers, and are still, as far as I know, continuing that holding today. They, I think, have not had such, a fair deal. From their point of view the equity of the Bank, which, is apparently not valued in the short term, is an important factor in the long term. I hope, therefore, that I am adding to the compliment I am seeking to pay to the Government in this repect, in saying that, while the compensation may be fair in the short run, it does not appear to me to be fair in the long run. However, let us recognise that there cannot be fairness both to stockholders and to taxpayers unless there is at least some element of doubt on both sides. May I raise two pointsâ€”one of the precedent for compensations in the future? Will the Member of the Government who winds up assure this House that at any rate compensation will be fair in the future? I agree that this is a very special  problem which will not precisely recur again, but may we take it that principles of compensation will be fair in the sense in which a jury of ordinary British men would consider that it was fair, and notâ€”and we have had disturbances in the political thought in the pastâ€”by the supposition that the definition of ""fair"" can be what is meant by fair by the wilder and more extreme elements of Socialism. Secondly, may we take it that in this case, and in all questions of nationalisation, the Government will watch carefully and will compare facts and figures. I am glad that the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. E. Davies) has said that we should debate the results of each year's working. I have seen the annual report and accounts of the Bank, and I am inclined to think that this House would be much more interested in an annual report which showed clearly what improvements nationalisation had brought in a higher standard of living, or in any other sense, to the common man of this country as between conditions as they were or as they would have been, and as they are found to have been in that year. I hope, too, that the Government will bring into effect a policy of sampling. Sampling and carefully watching enable you to avoid mistakes, and not only that but to learn from experience and develop new techniques. It is a great mistake to break all your eggs before you know, first of all, whether the customer wants them boiled or scrambled, and secondly, before you know whether you have the necessary cooking fats, and not only water, so that when you have broken them you can, at any rate, make scrambled eggs. Do the Government realise that no manufacturer would turn his factory over to a new process without first installing a pilot plant and thereby submitting the a priori reasoning to practical tests? It is strongly to be hoped that the Government will approach this problem of nationalisation by way of careful watching, testing, sampling and learning by experience; and that they will hazard the assets of this country only when they have fully established that those assets ought to be launched irrevocably, because with certainty of improvement. I come now to the main criticism of the Bill. So far as I can see it achieves nothing. We on this side of the House   have no difficulty whatever in agreeing that no national institution should be allowed to be in conflict with the will of the people. Where we differ, is in considering that nationalisation or coercion of the recalcitrant should take place only if and when a conflict has appeared, and not before. We can imagine that the Bank of England, a trade union or even the Trades Union Congress might embark on policies which were antagonistic to the interests or will of the peopleâ€”but they have not. To nationalise the Bank is to take away that most precious of all English and British values, the free association of people working freely together. The Chancellorhas told us how he expects that British habit of working freely together to be effective in the future as between the Bank and the joint stock banks. He has, in fact, told us how it has worked in the past as between the Treasury and the Bank of England. We might now pass a law to nationalise the Trades Union Congress for fear that it might conflict with national interest, but if we did so we should be making the same mistake, and with as little cause. Members opposite may say that there has been conflict, but that it has been behind the scenes. I think there is no justification whatever for that contention. Might I ask the House to bear with me over a few facts? First, there is the case of the deflation policy of 1920. That policy was adopted as the result of a Report by the Cunliffe Committee, and the Chancellor of the dayâ€”I think it was Sir Austen Chamberlainâ€”took full responsibility for that. The return to the Gold Standard in 1925 followed a Report by a Committee appointed by Mr. Philip Snowden on which the Bank of England was not even represented, and that policy was debated and decided in this House. The foreign loans in connection with the Dawes and Young Plans were not domestic issues; they were international issues. The very names of the men associated with them showed that it was America who took the lead. All the Allied nations were committed to them and, in fact, the Foreign Secretary, as much as the Chancellor, was the man responsible for those loans to Germany. The Prime Minister, at the time of the Dawes Plan in 1924, was Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and the Chancellor was Mr. Philip Snowden; at the time of the Young  Plan the Prime Minister was, again, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, with Mr. Arthur Henderson as Foreign Secretary and Mr. Philip Snowden as Chancellor. To say that the Bank was in any way responsible for that is completely to misread the situation. Finally, the fall of the Labour Government in 1931 was coincident with the loss by them of the confidence of the country. They not only lost nearly 2,000,000 votes at the coming Election, but they lost the confidence of their own Prime Minister, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, and of their own Chancellor and of many others. Indeed, they lost the confidence of the investing public overseas. Do let us realise that the Bank of England, as manager of the Government debt, acts as a conduit pipe through which willing investors from this country, the Dominions and foreign countries lend their money to our Government over here. The Bank of England cannot control that willingness, and to confuse effect with cause is wholly wrong. It is putting the cart before the horse. Is it not also an affront to our intelligence to suggest that a Central Bank, which, in effect, never advertises, could put across this country, across the world, a false story in the face of those magnificent machines of public relationsâ€”the Labour Party and the trade union movement? So far as I can sec, it seems perfectly clear that the people of this country have had the financial policies of succeeding Chancellors of the Exchequer and succeeding Governments, which they have voted to power through the support which this House has given to them. To say there has been conflict and to seek to lay the blame elsewhere is, I think, wholly wrong. Has any Member ever heard any Chancellor of the Exchequer disclaim responsibility and blame the Bank for what has happened in his period of office? It is true that we have heard the present Chancellor blame the Bank for what it advised the previous Chancellors, but I would ask again: Has anyone ever known a Chancellor get up and say, ""I am not to blame; it is the Bank which is to blame?"" The truth of the matter is that Governments of the past have had the best of two worlds. They have been able to have skilled advice, and to sit back and blame a silent organisation which has never answered backâ€”
