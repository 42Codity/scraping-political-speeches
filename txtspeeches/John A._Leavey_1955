At the beginning of this Parliament, last June, Mr. Speaker was kind enough to point out to new Members that when we rose to address this House the faces we should see before us would be those of hon. Gentlemen who would not necessarily be unduly prejudiced in favour of the sentiments we might express. I hope I show no disrespect if I use a colloquialism and say how right he was. The right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) will, I hope, understand if I do not seek to debate with him, because I amâ€”I hope understandablyâ€”most anxious not to abuse the courtesy which I know is extended to those who, like myself, find themselves addressing this House for the first time. I will confine myself to some general observations, and the first I wish to make is that while I am sure it is generally agreed that this is to be an important Measure, it has not outlined or embarked on an entirely new intention. From some very elementary researches, I find that as long ago as 1600 this House was invited by a private Member, a Mr. Hyde, to consider this problem. In the words of the historian, which I will quote: It appeared that the habit of granting to Ministers the sole right to manufacture and sell one or other articles of commerce had resulted in the fact that the monopolist had it in his power to raise the price of the monopolised articles to the detriment of the consumerâ€¦ And the record goes on: Great frankness characterised the debate. It occurs to me that in making a start in this matter some 350 years ago, our predecessors, at any rate in regard to their approach on this subject, followed a very similar procedure to that which we are following this afternoon. Nevertheless, although it is perhaps not entirely a novel intention, there are, I believe, certain distinctive features about this Measure. In the first place, of course, it does what much of our legislation aims to do, to protect one section of the community from exploitation by another section. But in this case it does it by aiming to restrict restriction. Secondly, as I see it, it is novel in that it invades an area of human activity which until now has been substantially free from legislation. Thirdly, and perhaps most important, it aims not only to  reverse a natural instinct, but to reverse what I believe is a notable trend in social behaviour over the last 20 or 30 years. It aims to stop a habit which is increasingly practiced by us all and increasingly condemned by us all. It seems to me that more and more as a community and as individuals we have come to rely upon collective activities; upon the decisions and leadership of our associations and our clubs, unions and so onâ€”and if I may say so, perhaps on the activities of our Whips. Because of this, I believe we may find that a very large proportion of those people who are to be involvedâ€”I believe that means the whole nationâ€”will find themselves at least trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds; at least trying to get the best of both worlds. I think we may find that the indignant plaintiff at one moment is the self-righteous defendant the next. I dare say, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that you will know of the works of James Bridie, and he is on record as saying on one occasion: Hypocrisy is the nearest approach the average man gets to goodness. I say, with the greatest respect to the House, that that comment upon human behaviour is significant and relevant at this time, and I think that something is to be learned and something is to be gained from it. I believe that the British people will gain some satisfaction from the fact that, on the one hand, right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite find the Bill too soft and, on the other hand, some leaders of British industry find it too harsh. I think that perhaps the judgment of the British people will be that because of these two condemnations, what my right hon. Friend is proposing is just about right. I have the honour to represent the Lancashire constituency of Heywood and Royton, and there we make no apology for having a deep vested interest in the cotton industry. Hon. Members will know, although perhaps some may have forgotten, that the Lancashire cotton industry got away to a flying start in the early days, 70 or 80 years ago, not just by chance, but because of vigour, drive, enterprise and determination to get on with the job in hand. Over the years our great traditional industry of Lancashireâ€”and it is still a great traditional industryâ€”has made an enormous contribution to the real wealth of this nation, and   that is something of which we in Lancashire are very proud. It may be that we are going to pass through difficult times, indeed, we have been passing through difficult times in that industry, and some of us feel that we are somewhat out on a limb. But I hope that one thing will be quite readily accepted by my right hon. Friend and indeed by the House, namely, that in our traditional industry we really shall not need this Bill to produce for us the invigorating effect of competition. We have had from Japan, India and Hong Kong, as well as from some of the manufacturing countries of Europe, quite enough competition to last us a lifetime. Nevertheless, I am very ready to support the Bill, as one who has the strongest convictions about the need for vigorous competitive enterprise. In our industry we have already seen the cloth printing side pass through the sieve of the Monopolies Commission, and, as my right hon. Friend knows, what was asked of that section of the industry was done. On the weaving side, I am sure that the most savage critic of restrictive practices will find little with which he can find fault. On the spinning side, admittedly, there are pricing arrangements, but I have no doubt that if it is necessary to look at these they will stand scrutiny. I think I am putting the point of view of a great number of people whom I have the honour to represent, but in the wider field I am very glad to have this opportunity which I sincerely hope I do not abuse, of supporting the Measure for what I believe to be sound reasons. I support the principle by which the practices laid down in the Bill are to be registered. As my right hon. Friend pointed out that must be right. I support the principle whereby the onus is on parties concerned to establish that a particular practice shall be justified. I believe that to apply blanket legislation in this case would do more harm than good. This is not an occasion, as I have tried to explain, when it would be proper for me to debate with right hon. Gentlemen opposite the relative merits of the two fundamentally different approaches to the problem, although I appreciate that hon. Members, and particularly hon. and learned Members, will find many fea-  tures embodied in the Bill with which they may reasonably quarrel. On the subject of delay, I do not know whether it is a precedent or a straw in the wind that such delay as has occurred so far has come from learned Gentlemen. Psychologically this will be a vital and useful Measure, and I believe that it will achieve practical success in what it sets out to do and that in present economic conditions it will make a very useful contribution. Whatever the observations and criticisms of the economic difficulties of our times, I hope it is generally accepted that if we are to survive in this highly competitive world, then from each hour of work, from each ingot of steel, each acre of land, and each bale of cotton more real wealth has to be obtained. If the Bill makes some contribution in that direction, then it should command the support of the House for that reason alone. I believe it will command the support of the country as a whole. May I express my humble thanks to the House for the patience with which hon. Members have listened to my observations on the subject.
