In rising to address this Committee for the first time, I certainly feel in great need of the indulgence which is customarily given to a beginnerâ€”particularly towards the end of a debate which has not been free from controversy. I want to move from the factories of Lancashire to the fields of East Anglia, because my constituency is mainly interested in agriculture. The criticisms with regard to agriculture to which I have  listened during the debate amount, broadly speaking, to the claim that farm guarantees have been whittled away; production is falling, and farmers are dissatisfied. All I can say is that that does not accord with my experience. During my short time in the House I have heard speeches which have claimed that farm guarantees were much too high. I can only suppose that the true position is best illustrated by the current issue of the monthly journal of the National Farmers' Union, which carries the headline, ""Just, But Only Just."" As a farmer, perhaps I should declare an interest in agriculture. I do not ask for more than justice, and I do not think that any reasonable farmer does. As to production, it has not fallen. There has been a steadily rising agricultural production ever since the war. The official figures show that in 1953 and 1954 the total had reached a record of 155 per cent. above pre-war. Admittedly, in the year which has just ended we have fallen back to 153 per cent., but that was due mainly to the weather. Farmers have to live with the weather; they have to gamble with it, and take its ups and downs. To the farmer, the weather is as harsh an enemy as are the terms of trade to an economist. As production climbs higher and higher, it is rather like going up Mount Everestâ€”the higher one gets the harder progress becomes. Farmers are said to grumble. I think that they were shaken last year because they had to adjust themselves to a greatly changing situationâ€”with the end of rationingâ€”and they and the Ministry suddenly realised that they were not too certain what the housewife would choose. One lesson which we have learned, among many, is that the housewife, together with most of the rest of us, does not much like fat. That has explained much of the lack of interest shown in some of our products, which can and have been improved in quality. At the moment, agriculture has a vital part to play because of its dollar-saving and export-saving capacity. Unless we are protected from unfair competition, especially from the influx of products from overseas which may be offered at less than the cost of production, we cannot fulfil our task of producing as much as we should to feed our people and keep   down our balance of payments requirements. In order not to impede world trade, and to give the housewife freedom of choice in the shops, we have devised a system of deficiency payments to replace the old fixed payments and allocations, rather than a protective tariff, which some farmers might prefer because it seems more respectable and is less open to criticism. The effect, however, is much the same. As the Chancellor made clear, the cost of agriculture last year was Â£246 million, which is 20 per cent. of our output of Â£1,250 million. If my mathematics are correct, that is equivalent to a 25 per cent. protective tariff, which is not out of line with the tariff protection given to other vital and vulnerable industries which we cannot do without. The 55 per cent. part of our increased output since the war represents more than Â£400 million as a direct saving in export earnings. I regard this protection not as a mattress, still less a feather bed, but as a shield, which enables us to attack the cost of production behind it. Our agriculture has been making a great technical advance each year. Last year it was worth Â£25 million but, unfortunately for the farmers, the costs arising off the farmâ€”over the majority of which they have no controlâ€”rose by Â£39 million, so that the final bill for the Exchequer went up and not down. I want to pursue this battle of costs a little further by going into the question of agricultural fixed investment. Agriculture is our biggest single industry, but it is a mosaic of thousands or hundreds of thousands of small enterprises, each bristling with its own physical and financial difficulties. If I may ask the Committee to descend from the sublime scale of the Economic Survey, in which every digit represents Â£1 million, to the petty time-and-money saving economies of farm routine, a quite remarkable fact will emerge. We have 360,000 farms as separate commercial units, two-thirds of which are of less than 100 acres. A common feature is that many of them have an obsolete layout and buildings designed long ago at a time when man was the only machine and skilled labour was cheap and abundant. They do not readily  lend themselves to modern and, as it were, streamlined production. Big savings are to be gained in a general modernisation of the layout of the small farm. One hour's labour saved daily on a farm is worth Â£50 a year. If, therefore, one hour could be saved on all farms under 100 acres, the total amount saved would be Â£12Â½ million. Similarly, if the routine on big farms Were so changed as to save a man's labour, that would be an annual saving of not less than Â£350 per farm Capitalised, that is a large sum. These changes are slow, and difficult to make. The Farm Advisory Survey will indicate over the next few years much that needs to be done, but there is a great need for fixed capital. That brings me back to the Economic Survey, which shows that the capital investment going into agriculture shows a small, but none the less welcome, rise compared with the much faster rate of capital going into other industries. It has increased at a slow over all pace but, nevertheless, the amount of capital going into agricultural building last year was Â£26 million. That is a record total and is Â£4 million more than in the previous year. That would seem to belie the suggestion that farming is not prosperous but I still doubt whether the amount of fixed investment is quite enough. Moreover, its distribution favours the large, the more fertile and well-to-do farm rather than the small and needy one. I wonder whether enough capital is going into small farms; and whether there is not some scope here for bringing down the average costs of production by an infusion of new capital. In the long run, this could help to bring about the sort of economies that we farmers would like to make. Could we consider a system of farm reconditioning grants in which the Government would lend the bulk of the capital at a low rate of interest? Such capital will not come from the small farmer or small owner for this sort of work. I would not want to add to Treasury liability; it might well be done by an extension of the production grants system, where money could be found to service any deficiency on such a loan from within the total support guaranteed for agriculture. This may be a small point to raise in the context of this debate, but we are searching for means to keep ourselves   progressively more efficient. Agriculture, particularly at this time, has a great opportunity. Rising standards mean an increased demand for good food, as has been seen in the last six or nine months. Likewise, the countryside was never more valuable as a market for the products of industry. In my own area, I expect to see the television aerials going up now that we have a local station. Full employment in the towns is inextricably linked with full production on the land. The farmer and the farm worker are very grateful for the firm and practical support which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the taxpayer have given us. We can, and we mustâ€”and, indeed, we very much want toâ€”go on from strength to strength in contributing our maximum effort to the economic well-being of the country.
