It is with real pleasure that I follow the hon. Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Gooch) as I know that he is a most respected leader of the respected farm workers of this country. I should like at the outset to pay a real tribute to that loyal body of men, the farm workers. I rise with a degree of diffidence to address the House in this, my maiden speech, but I am fortified in the belief that there is very general agreement on the provisions of this Bill between right hon. Members on both sides of the House. I have heard it said as I have walked around my county that it would be a good thing to take agriculture out of politics, and I believe that is exactly what the Bill aims to do. With the good   will of this House, I believe it will achieve that objective. I am fortified also by the fact that I have the honour to represent a constituency which is both a market centre and the centre of an agricultural county. My constituency has at its centre a city which has been established for nearly 2,000 years. During that long period, conquerors have come and wars have been fought outside our city walls. Many different kinds of activity have been carried on within those city walls, but there has been one continuing activity which has been for the benefit of the economy of Chester; throughout those twenty centuries, Chester has been a market place and a centre where the agricultural products of that happy hinterland could be exchanged. Throughout that period this has been the basis of the economy of our city. I believe that the Minister sounded the right note today when he said that the two main provisions of the Bill are stability and efficiency. In a changing world where so much emphasis is placed on mass production and turnover, the Bill sets out to achieve for agriculture that degree of stability which we cannot achieve by velocity of circulation. Agriculture's velocity of circulation is governed by nature's seasons. It is possible for us in agriculture to increase the size and improve the quality of our crops, but we cannot increase the velocity of circulation which must take place according to nature's calendar. I would go further and say that I welcome the retention in Clause 1 of the Annual Price Review. I certainly agree with the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) in his disagreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Sir R. Boothby) who made that unfortunate remark on Thursday last about the Annual Price Review. I think it is entirely right that prices should be reviewed each year, but strictly within the structure of these long-term provisions. It is just within this structure that I think there will be a degree of flexibility given by that annual survey, but which will mean that it will be possible for the farming calendar to be guided by a three- or four- or more course rotation. In agriculture if one is to improve one's  land, one must plan rotation over a period of years, and that is why this stability over a period of years will produce the best advantages for agriculturists out of their own acres. The livestock guarantees provide that over a period of three years there can be a maximum drop of only 9 per cent. I think that is right, because when one is planning a livestock programme it is necessary to look ahead. One cannot make a steer fit for Smithfield in the course of a year. It must be a three-year project. Therefore, I welcome this longer term guarantee, tied as it is to a minimum drop of 9 per cent. There is a feature in the Bill on which my right hon., Friend did not comment and which Ld as important. That is the question standard quantity. We who have been associated with the milk industryâ€”and here I must confess my personal interest as a milk producer for many years and as a member of Milk Marketing Board committeesâ€”have come up against this question of standard quantity. It is right that the Minister should include in the Bill provision for standard quantity because I do not think that any Government can hold prices indefinitely against the law of supply and demand when supply very much exceeds demand. Looking across the Atlantic to the great wheat belts of the North American Continent, or to the cotton belt, one realises that that country, with vast financial resources, has been fighting against over-production. I believe that a salient factor in the great slump which occurred in 1929 was this question of vast farm surpluses 'building up and overhanging the market. I do not suggest that there is any parallel between that and the milk industry. In the milk industry we have a perishable commodity and therefore the question is not quite so apposite. I suggest that these words, ""standard quantity"", will very soon become self-evident in their relation to the egg. I should like to see the proposed Egg Marketing Board become a very successful institution. I hope that it will be born. I believe that it will have a very real chance of expanding egg consumption in this country; because I believe that the ubiquitous egg can be handled with almost equal facility, as   regards its presentation for table, by the humble male as well as by the female. When the advertising gets going I think that the egg will be consumed in increasing quantities. I wish to stress the importance of Clause 3 which contains the tremendous twin stabilisers of the 97Â½ per cent., of which we have heard, andâ€”what I consider of even more importanceâ€”the fact that we in agriculture are to be guaranteedâ€”I would say insulated againstâ€”either inflation or deflation. I may be wrong, but that is the way I see it. We are to have a guarantee, so that ascertainable alterations in costs will be made good in the Annual Price Review. I congratulate the Minister on getting this accepted by the Treasury. I consider it a tremendous step forward. I believe that this is the first time a feature of that nature has been accepted by his right hon. Friend the Chancellor. I wish now to address myself to Part II of the Bill and the Second Schedule that goes with it. In his maiden speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Gains-borough (Mr. Kimball) referred to that part of the Bill. I wish to endorse his remarks, and to go a little further and say that I hope that many of the schemes envisaged as coming into operation under the provisions of the Bill will benefit those farms which are either small or remote, or both. Another aspect which my right hon. Friend did not stressâ€”I do not think he actually mentioned itâ€”is that under these provisions I believe that be is making allowance for the possibility of fixing standard prices for a certain amount of work, in the same way as he fixed standard prices in the Agriculture (Silo Subsidies) Act, I urge my right hon. Friend to employ a very real degree of flexibility in fixing those prices. Anyone who knows our countryside knows that the terrain varies between county and county, between farm and farm and even between field and field; and unless there is a real degree of flexibility in those prices, I feel that they will not achieve that measure of success for which we all hope. I realise that it is not possible for the farmer's own work to count towards a grant, but I hope that provision will be made for farm and estate labour to be included in some way or other. Were  this provision applied to industry, were it the case of a vast vertical combine in industry, the work could be carried out by a subsidiary company or even a sub-subsidiary company. We realise that in agriculture we are smaller units, but exactly the same type of provision, the same outlook, may apply, and I ask my right hon. Friend to bear in mind what I have said on this matter. Regarding Part III of the Bill, I welcome the emphasis on breeding in the pig industry and I feel that it represents a great forward step. I welcome also the provision whereby the nation-wide network of the Milk Marketing Board in the matter of artificial insemination will be made full use of. Frequently in agriculture a network which has been built up over the whole country is used for only one purpose, and it represents an important step forward that this network made available through the Milk Marketing Board will be used for more than one purpose. In that way we shall take advantage of the opportunity to decrease overhead expenses. I regard the Bill as the natural concommitant of the 1947 Act and I am sure that it will provide lasting benefits to agriculture. The fears about agricultural workers expressed by the hon. Member for Norfolk, North will, in my opinion, be dissipated. I believe that an efficient, healthy industry will always find a place for the agricultural worker. A healthy agricultural industry will bring good customers to our country towns and I believe that our retail trades will benefit, and that the expenditure of public money will prove to be of the greatest advantage to our country's economy. As I have said, I consider that the reliance on the Annual Price Review is entirely right. These long-term assurances, plus improvement grants, will mean that evolution and progress will move hand-in-hand with just that balance which nature knows so well. In the same way that the 1947 Act has become known throughout the countryside to the everlasting credit of the right hon. Member for Don Valley, so I believe will this Bill, when it becomes an Act, be known throughout the country to the everlasting credit of my right hon. Friend the present Minister.
