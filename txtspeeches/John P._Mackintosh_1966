It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) talking about dimming the harsh light of reality, when we have had not one word about what form of taxation the Opposition would introduce. As a maiden speaker I cannot, unfortunately, indulge in direct cross-Chamber repartee, which I would enjoy doing. For the whole of my adult life I have been teaching, studying and writing about the British system of government, and I rise with the usual feelings of humility and excitement, but perhaps to an even more intense degree. Hon. Members will appreciate that for someone who has always regarded an hon. Member of this House with a degree of excitement, much as a small boy tends to regard a new model car or a special jet plane, my entry to the House has created in me almost an unseemly pleasure and enthusiasm. I hope that hon. Members will excuse this. But what is to me a pleasure, is, unfortunately, a blow to others. I am sorry that my election was, of necessity, a blow to my predecessor, Sir William Anstruther-Gray. I learned to like and admire him during the contest. He was a genuine gentleman. He had an element of non-political approach which made hon. Members opposite choose him as Chairman of the 1922 Committee, and also persuaded this Committee to select him as Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means. I do not want anybody to think that he was not a decisive man in his way. It is perhaps not well known to hon. Members that Sir William was one of the men who returned from the Front in May, 1940, and persuaded 32 of his back bench colleagues to go into the Lobby against their own Governmentâ€”against the leadership of Neville Chamberlainâ€”  thus helping to bring down that Government. On that occasion he was a true patriot. Like my predecessor, I hope to represent efficiently the constituency which has elected me. I shall work hard on its behalf. I want to pick up two points which are obviously most important in terms of the economic policies of the Government. In my constituency, at the week end, I found that there was a tremendous feeling of gratitude and relief at the terms of the Chancellor's Budget. Every person who has considered it appreciates that when Â£6,000 million worth of manufacturing industries pay 40 per cent. of the taxation, whereas the service industries pay only 1 per cent., it is a reasonable proposition that tax should be increased in respect of the service industries. There has been no feeling other than relief that we have not gone back to a reliance upon increases in taxationâ€”on beer or tobaccoâ€”and all the other tedious methods of taxation adopted by past Chancellors. There is one particular aspect of this Selective Employment Tax which could be reorganised in the coming months to meet the Chancellor's desiresâ€”in no way to undermine his tax, but to help to allay the worries of the farming industry. I represent a constituency with some of the finest farming land in Scotlandâ€”
