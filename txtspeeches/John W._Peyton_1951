It is with very real trepidation that I rise for the first time in this Chamber to address the Committee, and I ask the Committee to show me that indulgence and sympathy which is normally extended to those passing through this very painful ordeal. I come from the Yeovil Division of Somerset. I represent a constituency which is, in large part, at any rate, agricultural, and it is on the subject of agriculture and its general economic position that I wish to address a few words to the Committee today. I think that the Budget has placed upon our home agriculture a heavy burden. In the first place, there are the very substantial cutsâ€”the necessary cutsâ€”in food imports. The responsibility upon our home agriculture is, therefore, proportionately heavier. There are the increased taxes on petrol and the increased costs, therefore, of transport, and there is the rise in the Bank rate. These must be viewed against the background of the past three years, when the costs of this  industry have risen by substantially over Â£200 million, Â£60 million of which has not been recouped. Full consideration should be given to agriculture now. I recognise, as has been generally recognised, that my right hon. Friend's Budget is a hopeful one. It is one of incentive. I most earnestly hope that those notes of hope and incentive will be echoed in the forthcoming Price Review. That review is now taking place, and I wish to make only a few very general comments upon it. First, I believe that the principle of the Price Review represents a sound policy. It is fair to say that in many cases it has been badly administered; it is a good vehicle which has been badly driven. The main purpose and aim of the policy behind the Price Review is the very necessary expansion of our home agriculture. The means of getting that expansion is to breathe into agriculture that extra working capital which at present is so badly lacking. The whole purpose of the policy is likely to be undermined, first, by the danger of rising costs, and second, by mistaken and sudden changes in price emphasis. If prices are switched suddenly and without warning simply because the output of a product has reached the target which represents the nation's needs, there is likely to be a disastrous and discouraging effect upon the industry. In particular, I refer to milk, in which, of course, the county of Somerset is so deeply interested. The target for milk was reached, but in the 1951 review recoupment for rising costs was not given. As a result, the cattle population of the country has fallen, and is falling today. We are faced with a situation when dairy cattle are sent, not to the bull, but to the butcher. Such action as that undermines the confidence which is at the root of any healthy and prosperous agriculture. I say very strongly indeed that no industry needs to much and such constant assurance as the widespread industry of agriculture, consisting, as it does, of some 350,000 individuals. The other day in my constituency, a farmer remarked to me, ""We know what Governments do. They look for cheap food from overseas; and as soon as they have found it they will pull out the props from under us and let us down."" I do not believe there is any   foundation whatever for such apprehension, but I am quite convinced that there is a real need for constant and repeated assurances to be given to this industry, which is so largely composed of individuals as against large concerns. The second point which the agricultural community require, perhaps, more than anything else is some stability, or, at any rate, some progress towards stability, of costs. Instead of the business of having from year to year ad hoc price increases, can we not aim, at any rate in the long term, for stability in costs, which would give to the consuming public the assurance that prices will not go up and may well come down? This would give to the farmer the reasonable opportunity which he must have for taking the longterm view. That could be done, I think, by administering an early stimulus to production rather than by the ad hoc price increases to which I have referred. The fertiliser subsidies and the ploughing up subsidies, introduced by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, are two notable steps along the road to which I am referring, but such things as calf subsidies, acreage payments and grassland improvement schemes could well be considered. Let me give just three reasons why I believe that this system of giving an early stimulant is so much to be desired. The first is that it does much to offset one of the chief difficulties of the farmer, lack of working capital. In this respect, particularly, the agricultural industry is in a very much more difficult position than any other industry. They have not got a well organised issue market to which they can resort; they simply go to the banks and their only means of capital is their revenue. In addition, the stimulant, which can be injected in the early stages of production, is valuable in that the benefit is confined to the man who is really genuinely making the very much needed effort to produce. The third point in its favour, which I think is the strongest of them all, is that it is a first-class investment from the point of view of the nation. Instead of the results we are seeing as a result of the purely ad hoc system that we have had over the last few years, we will get a steadily increasing volume, a volume  which will increase with confidence, and with that increase in volume we shall get a reduction in overheads and the stimulant will be needed less, and not more, as time goes on. I have been advised that the best quality of a maiden speech is brevity. Perhaps it is its only virtue. Therefore, I will conclude with a few remarks about that class of man on whose behalf I have spokenâ€”the small farmers, the small horticulturists, all over the country. It has to be remembered that the average farmâ€”in Somerset certainlyâ€”is not larger than 80 acres. The small farmer is a man who is patient. He has to put up with much, he is loyal, he is hard working and industrious. I would remind the Committee that he has to work a longer week than most sections of the community, even including hon. Members of this House. His normal working week is one of about 70 hours, and he is paid no overtime. We would do well to remind ourselves that if the small farmer were working for another employer, as a farm labourer, his statutory wage would very often be well in excess of what he earns working for himself. He has no feather bedâ€”I am not trying to be controversialâ€”I see that the hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. S. N. Evans) is not in his placeâ€”but I do believe that the lot which these men have to bear is a hard one. I am not suggesting that it does not get its reward, but I do say that it is to the small farmer we in this country have to look if we are to have the increased food production upon which so very much depends. We look to him, not as a man who is a member of a favoured class, not as a man who is in rivalry with our great urban population, but as a man who is willing, ready, and anxious to do a vital task in the interests of the country, a man whose principal aim is to safeguard and care for the land of which he is a part and to keep that land in full production and in good heart. I wish to thank the Committee for the courtesy with which they have heard me.
