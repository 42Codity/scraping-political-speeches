The question of relationships in industry may take on varied aspects, but, fundamentally, the principle is that of human relationships. I want to examine the principle from that point of view. I may bring down on myself criticism or objection from hon. Members on the Government benches, but I assure them that what I say is based on my own experience. I left elementary school when I was 14 and went into the mining industry. From the age of 14 I was in the mining industry until exactly one month ago today, when I tendered my resignation as a miners' lodge official. I had served for sixteen years as a lodge official. I have, therefore, had experience both of private enterprise and of nationalisation in the coal industry. Some of the feelings I express may cause a revolt among the Government's supporters, but I assure them that I do not speak in a provocative way but only to show the long way we have come. I remember the time when to be a member of a trade union was frowned upon by the coal owners, and we were  looked upon suspiciously when we held our trade union meetings. The colliery manager usually knew the next morning what had happened at the trade union meeting the night before.
