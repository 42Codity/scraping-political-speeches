I rise to address the House, for the first time, with great diffidence, and particularly so tonight, at this late hour, after such an extremely interesting Debate on foreign policy. For a very short time, I want to bring the attention of the House to more local matters, and to discuss the question of the appointment of justices of the peace in this country. At first sight, it would appear that that was a subject far divorced from that which we have been discussing today â€” It being a Quarter past Ten 0'Clock, the Motion for the Adjournment of the House lapsed, without Question put. Motion made, and Question proposed, ""That this House do now adjourn."" â€”[Mr. Mathers.]
