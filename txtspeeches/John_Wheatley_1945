It has occurred to me that if one takes the example of a county in which there is one non-county borough, one may find a large portion of the population, up to as much as a quarter, in one corner. That will make the sparsity formula work out badly for the rest of the county. The county is sparsely populated because a large portion of the population is in one corner. For that reason alone the formula laid down in the Bill requires looking into again. I hope that the Minister will take up this point and think over the matter again before we finally part with the Bill.
