I ask the indulgence of the House in making my maiden speech. I have been priviledged over the last 30 years frequently to listen to debates in this House from the Gallery. Although I had some tries at General Elections I never really expected to be standing in this Chamber today making a speech. It is a daunting prospect, although I must say that after the exhibition given by the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) it is not quite as daunting as I expected. I want to mention my predecessor, Tom Driberg. He will be much missed in Barking and in this House. He was first elected to Parliament in 1942 as the Member for Maldon and served in   that constituency until 1955. For the next four years he was outside the House. So eloquent was he as a writer, broadcaster and politician that when he returned as Member for Barking in 1959 many hon. Members found it difficult to believe that he had ever been away. I am proud to have been elected as his successor. Tom Driberg did a great deal for Barking and its constituents. I will try to serve them as he did. I cannot match his wit and his elegance with the English language. I shall try to follow his independence of mind and adherence to principles which have made him so widely respected in this House and the country. I am sure that hon. and right hon. Members in all parts of the House will join me in wishing him a long and happy retirement and good health to go with it. I understand that it is the tradition of maiden speakers to be non-controversial. I am not quite sure what this means. I have listened with great care to the hon. Member for Yarmouth. His speech has made my mandate to be non-controversial more difficult because I so profoundly disagree with almost every word he said.
