I am grateful to have caught your eye, Mr. Speaker, but it is with the greatest trepidation that I rise to speak to the House for the first time. I recognise the great traditions of the House as a debating Chamber; it is the finest in the world. We are following in the steps of many famous men of the past and also of many great men of today. I look at them sometimes and I tremble. I am sure the House will be pleased to know that I do not view myself as a giant colossus striding the world, but rather as a lesser man who goes between the steps. Nevertheless, I hope that the House will allow me some modest pride in that I have at least managed to reach the ranks of the House, where I hope to give a good account of myself on behalf of the electors of Birmingham, Perry Barr. Perry Barr is a swinging division. It is one of the few that has changed hands four times in the last four elections. In 1959 it was Socialist; in 1964 it was one of the few Conservative gains; in 1966 it went back again and now in 1970 it has advanced with the Conservatives once more. I hope that in future we shall not be quite so swingingâ€”a little more Conservative I hope. It would give me great pleasure if the division could settle down with its true partner, a man who has represented the Birmingham City Council for 16 years and has a real affection for his home division. My predecessor, Mr. Christopher Price, was young, personable and very likeable. He was well liked in his constituency, and he was a good constituency man who did a lot for the people in the area. He had a special interest in and knowledge of education. He was consistent in his pursuit of that interest and made many useful contributions to the House. I believe that Parliament will see him again but not, I hope, representing Perry Barr. Perry Barr was built between the wars. It has good quality housing and forms a dormitory area to the City of Birmingham, although its people are wide awake. Perhaps surprisingly, there is little industry within Perry Barr, Birmingham being the great industrial city it is. We have no slums, and no acres of modern little boxes dot our countryside. It is an area that has houses of character, with people to match. No rolling beauty am I able to claim for it, as many hon. Members can claim for their divisions. More important, especially in a welfare debate, we are concerned with housing. The majority of people in my division are happily and well housed. We should be proud of the Conservative record in Birmingham. Birmingham has been the leading authority in bringing in measures to help the poorer elements in our society. I was pleased to heard my right hon. Friend speak of the rent rebates to be introduced. Birmingham has already introduced rent rebates in the private sector. Once again Birmingham has led the country. Birmingham has also been the leading producer of houses for the people, and built 9,034 in 1967. I was a little cross to hear the right hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Edward Short) say, ""You should see a Birmingham Tory to believe."" Believe me, Birmingham Tories mean happier families. In an interjection recently an hon. Member referred to this side of the House as full of directors and chairmen, ""a subsidised minority."" I think there was more heat than sense in that interjection. When I recall how my wife and I have struggled to build a family busines, working 16 hours a day seven days a week to achieve a modest success, I resent being labelled as ""a subsidised minority"". There are many like us on these benches. One ought not to generalise in the House to that extent. I claim to speak on this Bill with some knowledge. My father died when I was 11, I was the eldest of three children, and there was no pension for the family at all. We were fortunate in having a small businessâ€”I emphasise that it was smallâ€”but, as all hon. Members know, a steelworks and coal mining area in the 1930s was not one of the most prosperous. Quite often, the outgoings of that busines were more than the income, and we had to sell many personal things to make ends meet and to meet our commitments. But it taught me a lesson, not a lesson of bitterness but a lesson of understanding. In welfare debates, we need understanding. We need to appreciate that no section of our community is prosperous unless we all are prosperous. There should not be the divisive words which we often hear from this side or that on these matters. I welcome the Bill as a progressive step forward. It embodies an entirely new approach, and it recognises the struggle of the less able to help themselves in the first instance, which is what we all want to encourage. I must tell hon. Members, if they do not realise it already, that the family allowance is generally disliked, particularly by those who do not receive it, for instance, the elderly who brought up a family without help and who cannot now understand why we subsidise so generously those who they think are able to look after themselves. That is their opinion, and we should take it into consideration. The family allowance is disliked by those who receive it and have it clawed back from them, in a sort of ""Now you see it, now you don't"" process. That does not commend itself to them, and the dislike would be aggravated if we took the course of increasing family allowances overall, with an extension of the claw-back principle. Incidentally, those who cry ""Means test"" should recognise that the claw-back system carries implications of the means test in any case. This should be clearly understood. It is cleverly disguised, but it is based on an income tax assessment. I feel that there is a pointer here in relation to the new allowances, and I hope that the Minister will look at it in this context. Why should we rely on a proliferation of forms for people to fill in when one ticket, as  it were, could do a common job for all Departments? It might overcome many of the objections. We all know from practical experience and from welfare work in our constituencies where the Bill will help. The hon. Lady the Member for Hitchen (Mrs. Shirley Williams) agreed that one real advantage of the Bill is that for the first time it includes the first child of a family. We must all welcome that, having seen the disadvantage of the other arrangement in the past. There are many families with just one child who are certainly in need of such help as we can give. Moreover, the Bill will, in my opinion, restore the level of incentive which is missing in the present system for helping the family. The social security benefit system is very good, but, when a man has social security benefits, he may not be inclined to take a job with earnings lower than or only as good as the social security benefit itself. The new proposals are not perfect, but they represent a genuine attempt to overcome a problem. I am certain that those who will feel the benefit of the new scheme more than anyone else are the widows, single women and deserted wives, those who are striving for independence and who, when they take part-time jobs at a small wage, find that they lose all benefit from social security. This is not right, and we should alter it. The Bill will be a help to the married couple with a job problem due to illness or other incapacity, incapacity, perhaps, not known to many or even private only to themselves. I hope also that it will help grandparents who have a child or children to look after from a broken family or from a family in which one or both of the parents have died. I hope that my right hon. Friend will look into this possibility. I have tried to read into Clause 1 provision to cover that circumstance, and I hope that it does. If I am wrong, I ask my right hon. Friend to see that something goes in to help grandparents in that way. In every way, the Bill offers a better deal. It offers a better deal for the country, and it offers to a section of our community the opportunity for greater independence, though not fully, for I am certain that, by and large, there are those who, for some medical or physical   reason, cannot take advantage of full-time work. Nevertheless, the Bill will be a help to them. It is not a means-test depressive Measure. It is designed to raise family status. All people receiving benefit under it will be able to say, ""At least I am trying, and a Government who care are trying to help"".
