I crave the indulgence of the House on the occasion of my first speech. I am particularly disappointed that on this occasion I feel it necessary to criticise the Chancellor. I know that he has brought forward a very popular Budget and, generally speaking, its proposals are acceptable not only to those on this side, but in the main to those on the other side of the House, but this is a popular Budget which has been   marred by one or two blemishes. My hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, when speaking to the House last week, said he spoke with a humble and contrite heart. I speak with a very sad heart, because I do hate criticising the Chancellor, knowing his kindly disposition towards good causes. I am amazed that he has overlooked a piece of financial meanness. I refer to the Purchase Tax on what are broadly termed visual aids to education. I cannot believe that he intends to persist in imposing this tax. He has made, I suppose, what he considers to be a very liberal reduction. The tax is to be reduced from too per cent. to 33â…“ per cent., but I am sure that the Chancellor did not fully realise the implications of this tax in so far as these very desirable pieces of educational equipment are concerned. I appeal to him to be liberal and magnanimous in the interests of education because, after all, the amount of the income that this is likely to realise is indeed negligible. When it was first imposed it was thought that this type of equipment which is used for educational purposes was in the nature of amateur equipment, and during the war the tax might have been justified, but we are now in peace time and there is to be a great advance on the educational side. We feel, therefore, that every piece of equipment which can be advantageously used for educational purposes should be absolutely free of taxation.
