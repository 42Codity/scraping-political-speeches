I welcome the opportunity of speaking in this Debate and making my maiden incursion into the Debates of the House on this subject, because I represent a division in a development areaâ€”the newest or next to newest of the development areas, Merseyside. Before I speak about it, may I pay respectful tribute to the great kindness, courtesy and assistance that have been shown to me, in common with the other newcomers to this new assembly, by the officials of the House and by all in these historic buildings during the time we have been going through the difficult process of assimilation. I am sure I speak for all new hon. Members when I say how difficult our lives would have been had it not been for this kindliness and courtesy. The subject of the development areas, which is raised by the Bill, is one that has engaged the attention of this party in the past and the attention of the Liverpool City Council, to which the President of the Board of Trade referred in introducing the Bill. I feel that it would be a pityâ€”I am sure he will agree with meâ€”if any wrong impression were to be left upon hon. Members or the country as to the attitude of the Liverpool City Council to the proposals that Liverpool and Merseyside as a whole should be declared a development area. I was privileged, as a member of the City Council, to be concerned in the discussions which took place between 1945 and the declaration of the Merseyside area as a development area, and I felt that the President of the Board of Trade was in danger of misleading the House when he declared that the Liverpool City Council was opposed to and resisted the declaration of Merseyside as a development area. Our attitude was that Merseyside as a whole might perhaps benefit from being declared a development area but that Liverpool itself, as a city, had already, away back in the bad old days  of the '30s, acquired, under a private Act, all the powers and authorities belonging to the Board of Trade as a result of the 1945 Act. When operating the provisions of that Act Liverpool had been highly successful in attracting industries to and in providing work in Liverpool. Some of us were a little disturbed at the circulation by the President of the Board of Trade, at a rather crucial stage in the General Election, of a memorandum described as, ""The Employment Situation on Merseyside: Statement by Mr. Harold Wilson, President of the Board of Trade."" I am bound to say that I admire his timing more than his strict regard for accuracy in some of the inferences that are made in the document. In the peculiarities of my position in delivering a maiden speech, I must resist the temptation to use language stronger than would be proper, and I am sure that he will sympathise with my very great difficulty in dealing with the matter. The document declared that in 1948 the Liverpool Council made it clear that, while they were themselves opposed to scheduling, they would not stand in the way of the other local authorities, such as Birkenhead, Bootle, and so on. The fact is that several times in the period immediately before the scheduling of Merseyside, different members of the Government, including the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, expressedâ€”as recently as 1948â€”grave doubts as to whether any advantage could accrue from the scheduling of Merseyside as a development area. This might well go on record to avoid the possibility of any wrong impression being left by the President of the Board of Trade. In this new Bill we are concerned with furthering the provisions of the 1945 Act and making sure that the industrial resources of the country are as widely and as wisely used as possible, both now, when we need to call into our service all the assistance that we can from our industry and from the skills and aptitudes of our people to tide the country through the present difficult period and in future. If the Bill can contribute in any measure to that, I am sure that the Opposition will welcome it and endeavour to see that it is operated as successfully as possible. We are, however, concerned that any   Measure such as this, which purports to assist in the scientific use of the resources of the country, should be applied on the broadest possible basis, taking into account all the different considerations that apply in any matter of national planning. The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. F. Willey) referred to the possibility that it might now be necessary to apply different considerations in operating the provisions of the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945. The Government might also bear in mind the various other claims which are made upon the resources of the country at present while they are considering putting into operation some of the provisions of the 1945 Act and this Bill. In Merseyside we have developed industrial estates. In Liverpool we have the great Speke estate, the estate at Fazackerley, and the new estate out at Kirby. Our problem is not one of attracting new industries to Liverpool but, as the President well knows, of building factories in the city to accommodate the industrialists who are anxious to come there and provide employment for the large reserve of mainly unskilled labour that exists on Merseyside. Since the end of the war more than 10,000 of our people moved from Liverpool in search of jobs in other parts of the country. Many have come back because of the impossibility of conducting a civilised life in ""digs"" in a Midland town while their wives and families were living in the City of Liverpool. The Liverpool problem is not only one of attracting the industrialists to the city, nor is it only the problem of building factories for the industrialists; it is also a problem of building factories and the houses for the people who live in the city and who can find work and employment and a full life in the new estates which the city is anxious to develop on its perimeter. The President of the Board of Trade is familiar with this problem; indeed, I think I am quoting him correctly when I say that he has pinned his political future to solving the problem of unemployment on Merseyside. No one would be more happy than I to see his political future secured at this price. However, I must say to the right hon. Gentleman that he has a responsibility in this matter that he can solve jointly with  his colleague the Minister of Health. Out at Kirby the city owns some hundreds of acres which it is anxious to develop as an industrial estate surrounded by a great housing estate. Industries are wanting to come there. Men, and women too, are waiting for jobs in those factories. There is a long journey from the centre of the City of Liverpool to these industrial estates, and I know that these conditions apply to industrial estates on the perimeters of other cities. There is difficulty in attracting even unemployed labour from the city to the factory areas on the perimeter because of the time involved and the high weekly cost of fares. Also, it has to be considered that managements are compelled to take these factors into consideration in fixing wage rates on which their costs of production are, to some extent, based. The building of a housing estate alongside the building of the industrial estate would go a long way towards solving our problem in Liverpool and, in some part, the problem of the country in earning its revenue in the markets of the world. There is one other aspect of this matter. The Government are now really concerned with directing industries into the development areas. Indeed, in Liverpool we are not without appreciation of the help given by the Board of Trade in steering industries to the Liverpool area, both before it was declared a development area and since. In time, as world competition becomes keener and as our industries find a less ready market, the problem may be one of finding jobs, of creating new work, and it is to that aspect that I would direct the attention of the President and his colleagues now. The development areas are those areas which have had a heavy burden of unemployment in the years between the wars. We on this side of the House are as anxious as any member on the Government side to see that those conditions do not return. Indeed, this Bill stems from the White Paper on Employment Policy of 1944 and the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945, to which hon. Members on this side of the House contributed not a little. In so far as the efforts of the President of the Board of Trade are directed to securing that end, we on this side will give the right hon. Gentleman our support.
