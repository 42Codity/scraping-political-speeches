As one who, in the last Election, was fearless and frank in telling the electorate that I felt perfectly satisfied in my own mind that a great number of controls would have to continue in operation for some years after the war came to an end I say frankly that I, at any rate, cannot be challenged on the ground that I misled my electors into voting for me. This Bill has been repeatedly referred to by hon. Members opposite as a very bad Bill. That expression has been used time and time again, but I would point out that hon. Members opposite, in putting forward their pleas, have repeatedly used the same arguments with reference to the same Clauses of the Bill, while purposely avoiding reference to those Clauses which arc of very great importance and will be for some considerable time to come. If a Bill is a bad Bill it is bad in its essence; it ought not to be judged on a line or a word here and there, or a Clause. Taking the Bill in its general terms, do hon. Members opposite still say that it is a bad Bill? We all know that there has to be a period of transition from war to peace during which it is necessary to maintain certain controls in the interests of the State and of the individual. No hon. Members dare say even now that they   would get rid of all controls. They know that we must retain certain controls until the time arrives when we can say that we have settled down to normal conditions. Let us never forget, in discussing this Bill, that reference has been made, time and time again, to the fact that at a particular time in a particular year the controls would go entirely. It cannot be as bad as hon. Members opposite would have it be, if provision is made so that when the appropriate time arrives we shall remove the controls as it becomes automatically possible to do so. I have been impressed very much as I have listened to the Debate and I have been forced to one conclusion. Hon. Members of the party which has controlled the destinies of the people of this country for many years find it difficult to realise that, at last, they are in a minority. I sympathise with them very much indeed, because until I came into this House I sat on a local authority for 26 years and I was always in a minority. I appreciate the feelings of hon. Members opposite, but I ask them not to oppose only for the purpose of opposing. They should not oppose because in their judgment, rightly or wrongly, the Government, having such a large majority will use it, as an hon. Member has said, as a bulldozer. The object and purpose of His Majesty's Government is to legislate on the lines indicated in the policy enunciated by the party to which the people of this country gave an overwhelming mandate. If we do that, there can be nothing wrong about it. I take the greatest exception to hon. Members opposite saying that because we are doing that, we are becoming totalitarian in our outlook. No hon. Member refuses more than I do to become totalitarian, and the fact that the Government are not taking up that attitude is demonstrated by what my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) said. The opportunity still exists for this House to discuss the whole of this Bill Clause by Clause, line by line, word by word, and to vote upon it accordingly. Before hon. Members level a challenge against the Bill that it is distinctly bad, let us rather, during the rest of this Debate, take advantage of the remaining time and debate its good points. I would refer to the power to give directions to local authorities, and I wish to say that local authorities have been  somewhat disturbed for a long time about what their position would be, if that particular part of the Act, which we understand now is to stand for the time being, was likely to expire immediately the war came to an end. Those who have been faced with some of the heavy responsibilitiesâ€”and I want to make this point clear because it is importantâ€”at least will know now where they stand and what power and function they can perform in righting those things which have been heavily disarranged during the war. One can go on from that standpoint to certain other aspects. There are safeguards in the Measure which enable us to settle down until the period when, as a result of these Regulations being no longer necessary, we shall have established legislation of a certain characterâ€”[Interruption.] If the hon. Gentleman opposite wants to be insulting, I have no objection. I have not asked for the indulgence of the House, but I tell him that I am making my maiden speech and I do not want to be insulted. If I were an old Member, perhaps I would have been shown some indulgence from hon. Members opposite. As the years pass away the House will have cause to realise that what the Government have done has been in the interests of the nation and the people generally who had the inspiration to send them to power.
