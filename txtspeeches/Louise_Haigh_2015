Does the Leader of the House share my concern about the news that the BBC is due to air a programme entitled â€œBritainâ€™s Hardest Grafterâ€ which has been dubbed â€œThe Hunger Games for the unemployedâ€? May we have a debate on whether the BBC is fulfilling its objective to air programmes of quality and distinctiveness?
