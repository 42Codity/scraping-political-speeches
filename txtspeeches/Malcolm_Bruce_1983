Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for calling me on this, my first occasion of speaking in the House. I suspect that, like many other hon. Members who are here for the first time, I am doing so with a sense of unreality that I am actually here. After spending nine years trying to achieve this goal, it is an   experience to address the House for the first time. I am glad to be able to do so. I hope that I shall have many more opportunities to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker.
