A number of Members have emphasised the fact that self-government should not be an issue between Scotland and England. I wish to stress that point. After all, we in Scotland still quite like the English, although that does not mean to say that everything is satisfactory. What we are up against is that people want to have a greater say in their own affairs in every locality. In Scotland generally, we complain with a certain amount of justice, of control from London, but I have also heard people in Inverness complaining of control from Edinburgh and people in the Isle of Skye complaining of control by Inverness. What we are up against is remote control, and not simply the question of self-government. It may be that self-government or a Parliament for Scotland will be the answer, but I should like to associate myself with what the Duke of Montrose, who is one of the leaders of the Covenanters, said. He insisted, whatever party came into power, on having a full fact-finding inquiry, without which nothing worth while can be done. I put that forward for consideration.
