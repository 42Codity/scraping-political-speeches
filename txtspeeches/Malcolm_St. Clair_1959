I understand that it is customary for an hon. Member to crave the indulgence of the House when making a maiden speech. I must crave the indulgence of the House even more, perhaps, than other hon. Members have done since I arrived here in rather peculiar circumstances. This morning I decided to talk about the Territorial Army as opposed to the Regular Army. I am a serving member of the Territorial Army, and I thought that since this is a maiden speech I ought to make it about something with which I am closely connected. In fact, the Territorial Army has three rÃ´les: the straight military rÃ´le, the Civil Defence rÃ´le and also a social rÃ´le. When the Government finished with National Service, some people thought that many young men would miss the opportunity of adventure and discipline but that we could supply this in the Territorial Army. Many young men come to us. We take them on adventure training, and when they leave the Territory Army they surprise themselves with their own physical fitness and skill. This is an important rÃ´le throughout the country, and it is also valuable in a more strict military sense. The next rÃ´le is that of Civil Defence. I know that when my Regiment, the Royal Hussars, was invited to take part in Civil Defence activities, it was not very excited. The men thought that this would be pretty dull and that they had joined the Territorial Army to be soldiers and not civil defence experts. But they ultimately discovered that it was not so easy as it looked, and in fact they made some bloomers. After that they realised that there is more in   training for Civil Defence than they had originally thought, and then they applied themselves with a considerable vigour. The establishment of the Territorial Army is 123,000 men, of which the figure now is about 108,000. I should like to give the House some local figures of the Bristol area. The North Somerset Yeomanry/44th Tanks have thirty officers and 324 men, the Royal Gloucester Hussars 32 officers and 334 men, the Fifth Battalion of the Gloucester Regiment 34 officers and 389 other ranks, and the Somerset Light Infantry 30 officers and 293 other ranks. We have to admit that these figures are not very exciting, but they show a slight improvement over the last six months. One reason, in my opinion, that recruiting has gone up is that the Government are spending a great deal of money on buildings for the Territorial Army and we are sharing the money that is being spent with the Regular Army. This year alone they are spending Â£1Â½1 million on two drill halls being built for the Gloucester Hussars. This makes it an extremely well equipped Regiment, at any rate in buildings. I hope that when these valuable sites are soldâ€”very often they are in the centre of townsâ€”the Territorials will got the benefit of the money which they have raised and that it will not disappear into Government funds. I should now like to mention equipment. I feel that it would be money well spent if the Territorial Army could have a little more modern equipment for training. I have in my car a wireless set which still has Russian numerals on it, so it must have been intended for the Russians at the end of the last war. It is therefore not in the first flush of youth. I also think that if it were possible to allow more Territorial officers and soldiers to train with B.A.O.R. it would serve two very valuable purposes. First, it would be very good military training, and, secondly, it would impress our N.A.T.O. Allies that we have a reserve Army behind B.A.O.R. and that we take the reserve Army seriously. It could well have considerable political advantages. The Territorial soldier is not a great expense to the taxpayer. I am told that he costs about Â£200 a year to keep. I do not know what the Regular soldier costs, but it must be a great deal  more than that. I feel that, if a little more money were spent on equipmentâ€”and, after all, the Territorial establishment vis-Ã -vis the entire Army Estimates is only 5 per cent., which is not very largeâ€”the results accruing would be out of all proportion to the extra money that it would cost the taxpayer.
