I think that the right hon. Gentleman is quite right, Mr. Speaker. The process before any legislation, which, I should think, would be legislation to authorise a treaty, is a very lengthy one. I hope, therefore, that you, Mr. Speaker, would regard the rule about the discussion of legislation as hardly applying. What we are discussing today is the beginning of negotiations which may last for a year or more and then be followed by action ultimately leading to a treaty.
