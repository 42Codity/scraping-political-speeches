Would the Chancellor state what the extra costs are of administering the family income supplement? Secondly, will he accept that the ending of the investment grants and the notion of replacing them by depreciation allowances is a step even further back from that which existed in 1963? At that stage there was an investment allowance system. So we have gone very far back along the road of reducing investment incentives well below the level operating in most countries in Europe today, and in certain other industrial countries, too. Does he realise the enormous significance of this?
