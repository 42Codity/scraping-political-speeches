): As the new Member for Islington, North, I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words in memory of my predecessor, the late Gerry Reynolds. During the 11 years he represented the constituency he was universally respected for his dedication in representing all sections of the community. He was always ready to help. he held regular ""surgeries"", and was always willing to receive telephone calls at his home. He had an enormous fund of experience and wisdom built up during his many years of service in local government in Acton. In this Chamber, he was known as one of the fastest speakers, but his speed was combined with sound good sense. As a Minister of the Crown, Gerry Reynolds served loyally in the Ministry of Defence. Officers and men in units of our defence forces in scattered corners of the world recall the individual and personal interest he took in their problems and responsibilities at every level. His achievements during his 41 years were greater than most will achieve in a full span of years. His untimely death is a tragic loss to his wife and family, to Islington and to this House and the future government of this country.
