Having been elected to the House in the recent series of by-elections, I rise to take part in this debate on unemployment with more diffidence than is normal, even for a first effort. I am well aware of my own limitations, and I trust that the House will show its usual courtesy and indulgence towards a first speech. Part of my diffidence is because I am from Clydeside and the people from Clydeside are well awareâ€”perhaps those from other areas are not so awareâ€”of our long record of people who have come to the House from that area, starting with one whom most hon. Members would agree to have been a very distinguished Member and whom, I am sure, my hon. Friends would regard as the most distinguished Member who, although he came from the Clyde Valley, was first elected for the West Ham Constituency of London seventy years ago this month. In the 1920s, there came a very vigorous, individualistic and energetic band of Members. They made a strong impression on the House and, through the House, on the country. Most of them have now passed on, but it is nice to see that one of the original band is still in the House and is still very vigorous and forceful. All of those Members spoke of unemployment, because the problem was then as great as, or much greater than, it is today. I am well aware that Scottish Members tend to be Chauvinistic   and cause a certain irritation and annoyance among the less fortunate Members of all parties. I have no desire to increase this irritationâ€”
