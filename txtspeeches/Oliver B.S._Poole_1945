I have already, like so many others, begged the indulgence of this House on the occasion of my first intervention in a Debate, and my only justification for rising to-day is that I myself was recently serving in the Forces and am expecting, in the course of the next week or so, to go through the actual machine of demobilisation. I also think it is very important that those of us who were or are in the Services and have now been translated to another sphere should not too readily forget the anxiety with which we ourselves awaited this demobilisation scheme, or the emotion with which we received it. I am also very well aware that when we came here as candidates for the Election many of us were congratulated by our friends at having found a loop-hole in the scheme by which we could get out of the Forces more quickly, or at any rate spend the summer with our families even if we had subsequently to return. I feel that speakers in this Debate have two very great responsibilities. It is most important that nothing should be said in any part of this House which will rouse false hopes or sow the seeds of discontent  among the men who are serving at home or abroad, and that nothing should be said that will in any way embarrass our commanders abroad, who have a tremendous task to carry out and who feel that they can only do it if they have the support of the whole country behind them. There are certain features of this vast problem, which affects every aspect of our national life, to which I want briefly to refer. On 16th October a statement was made by the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for War regarding the release of certain categories of officers, and the point I want to make is that very great hardship has been caused to those officers by being put back at such very short notice. This affects not only their own plans but also the plans of various employers who had arranged to give them employment in civilian life. It is quite impossible these days for an officer to make suitable domestic arrangements, particularly in view of the difficulty of getting a house or of moving a family from one town to another. It is equally impossible, as I know from my own experience since I came back, for an employer satisfactorily to plan his staff if he does not get long warning of when people are coming back. Even now there is considerable uncertainty. Only last night I was returning to London in the train from my constituency and one or two officers were talking. One of them had got papers advising him that he would be released on 20th November and he now understood that that release was to be held up. Another who thought that he would be out at the end of the year now did not know. There is a feeling of uncertainty, and I do urge that a full and comprehensive statement should be made as soon as possible covering the dates by which groups will be released during the next 12 months. The right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for War also stated that the shortage of officers in the early period of the release scheme could be met in two ways. The first way to which he referred was by inviting officers to defer their release voluntarily. I would like to endorse what the hon. and gallant Member for the Isle of Wight (Sir P. Macdonald) said on that occasion, when he urged that the conditions of future service should be published as soon as possible, because there were many, both   officers and other ranks, who would like to remain. But there are many officers who have now despaired of ever getting a satisfactory answer to that question and who have, therefore, in order to protect themselves, found employment in civilian life and are accordingly lost to the Service. It is too late, the damage has been done, and though many remain for periods of limited service the highest quality officers, who can most easily find employment in civilian life, have already done so and have been lost to the Service. The delay in issuing the conditions of service has resulted in a lowering of the standard available to the Service. One last point on this particular aspect of demobilisation. I think we are entitled to ask the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for War what are the circumstances which persuaded the Government in September of this year to agree that the military necessity clause could be put on whole groups and not only on specific individuals. In January of this year it was fully appreciated that the resources that would be available at the end of the war against Germany for the disbanding and disarmament of the German Army, and for such civil relief as would be necessary, would be totally inadequate. Representations were made to the Government that the demobilisation scheme should be slowed down in respect of officers and other ranks of certain categories. 'We received a categoric answer that in no circumstances would the military necessity clause be put on whole groups of people, but only on individuals. It would be true to say that subsequent events have proved the task greater than was thought. It is very difficult to assess what forces are required for the occupation of Germany until the exact policy of the Government and of the Control Commission is known. But it is quite certain that if Germany is to be completely disarmed and her war potential completely destroyed, and if her army is to be completely disbanded, the resources of the British Army are totally inadequate. It is purely a question of degree, and nothing can have happened since to make the task seem greater. In fact, the very reverse is the case, as has been pointed out. Nevertheless, the reversal of that decision at such a late date has not only caused very great hardship to the men  who were involved in it and who could have been told in May, but has also considerably affected the planning by the military authorities. What are the special circumstances that came along in September which were unknown earlier in the year and which led the Government to give way to the military authorities? The next point to which I would like to refer concerns redundancy. Like every other Member of this House, I have been deluged with letters from men in all the Services who say their demobilisation is being held up, but yet they are kept in camp or barracks kicking their heels and doing nothing. I know very well that there are many explanations, but I also know, and I think every hon. Member on both sides of this House knows, that economy of man-power is not widely practised in any of the Services. I shall accordingly try to make two constructive suggestions for economy of man-power. The first is that the Government should order an immediate reduction in the size of headquarters staffs. Staffs during the war reached fantastic proportions, and I think the peak was reached in May this year. Reductions are being made, I know, but they are not being made fast enough, and it is as true in India and South-East Asia to-day as it was in North Africa in 1943 to say that never have so few been commanded by so many. It is no use asking commanders voluntarily to reduce their staffs. I have seen this done not once but many times. There are too many vested interests, and it is a case where the Government must use those compulsory powers that they have been so busily acquiring during the last few days. War establishments must be reduced and appointments downgraded. The reason I say that is that the higher rank officers get the more assistants they consider they require. I know that from my personal experience. I have been on the staff in this war. I have done the same work during the whole war, with one big difference. When I was a major or captain, I did it either by myself or with one assistant. When I became a colonel I had a large staff of lieutenant-colonels, majors and captains who did my work for me and to whom I issued orders to do it. The hon and gallant Member for Hitchin (Major Asterley Jones) can testify to that from his personal experience. The point to remember is that   by reducing the number of staff officers, many of whom, I know, are quite unemployable in other spheres, a proportionate reduction is made in Royal Engineers, signalmen, cooks, batmen and so on, who are urgently required elsewhere. My second suggestion is that the number of officers and other ranks employed on the strength of depÃ´ts in this country should be investigated. I think the House would be interested to have the figures. I am informed that there are something like 8,000 other ranks on the strength of the R.A.C. base depÃ´t alone, and the same applies to every other base depÃ´t in the country. What do they do? I speak as an unemployed officer myself, but then, I know that I am militarily unemployable. What are these large numbers of unemployed men doing at the moment? The next point I want to raise is one that has been raised before, but it is so important that I do not apologise for raising it again. It is very discouraging that no improvement has been made in this direction. I refer to the question of how alterations to the demobilisation scheme are put over to the Services. It is just as important that the men should think the scheme is a good one as that it should be a good one. When the scheme was originally put out, it was put out as being the only fair scheme. Personally, I believe it to be so. Therefore, every amendment to the scheme calls for, at the same time as the amendment is made, a statement and an explanation most carefully worded and most carefully put out, because it must not be forgotten that statements made in the House and to the Press very often get quite a different interpretation when they are discussed in canteens and messes abroad. For example, take the statement that was made by the Under-Secretary of State for Air when he was discussing the speed of release in the Royal Air Force. I know there was considerable substance in the explanation he gave. I know that from personal experience, quite apart from what the hon. Gentleman said; but in his anxiety not to raise false hopes, in his anxiety also to emphasise his arguments, he cast gloom and despondency over many R.A.F. stations both in this country and abroad. I know that to be so from correspondence I have since received. I fully appreciate  the difficulties, but I believe it is just as important that the amendment should be properly put over as that it should be right in substance. In conclusion, I believe the future of this country depends a great deal upon the success of the demobilisation scheme. I believe that the age and service group scheme is the best that could have been devised. I deplore any amendment that has had to be made to it. I urge the Government to keep to the scheme as closely as they possibly can, particularly as it affects men serving in the Far East. I believe that to increase Class B and compassionate releases would cause more dislocation and dissatisfaction than would be the case if the scheme were adhered to.
