I crave the indulgence of the House on this, the first occasion on which I have taken part in a debate. I represent a constituency well known for its farming ability and in which we have holdings of all sizes from the very small horticultural holding  to the large2,000-acre mechanised holding. No area in the country did more to help the war effort. As I must not be controversial on this occasion, the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mr. T. Fraser) and the hon. Member for Shore-ditch and Finsbury (Mr. Collins) will not expect me to follow their arguments. Many like myselfâ€”and I must here declare my interestâ€”who depend on British agriculture for their living believe that it is the large and ever-increasing demand on the Exchequer to maintain price support and the failure to increase consumer demand for our products that really give concern to the British farmer. The solution to both those problems is to lower the unit cost of production by increasing the output per acre, the output per man-hour and the output per Â£ invested in the industry. Low costs are nearly always associated with high production. By that means alone can we assure the long-term stability of British agriculture and guarantee a fair profit to farmers and fair wages to their employees. Any capital available at present should be used to increase production on efficient farms and not used for the reclamation of land which at present is not in high production. During the period of expansion from 1938 onwards, the industry has succeeded in lowering, in real terms, the unit cost of production. However, the time is rapidly approaching when many holdings will be unable to continue that improvement and will be unable to make full use of new techniques and new information from our research scientists, unless more capital is available. There are already signs on some British farms which, as a result of good husbandry and aided by production grants, have increased grass production, but which unless they have more livestock and more suitable buildings to hold that livestock, will not make an economic use of that increased production. Those who have studied the implication of the National Farm Survey of England and Wales have no doubt about the size of the problem with which we are faced. To anyone used only to industrial finance, it is amazing that an industry in which the ratio between the capital assets and the debts outstanding is four to one is unable to raise all the capital which it requires. Of course, those of us connected with agriculture are fully aware   of the reason. Our great industry is split into about 370,000 holdings, many of them quite small, so that we find ourselves in the position that although the industry in toto is great, we have individual units which cannot raise the capital they need, even though the reason for that capital is in the national interest. I suggest that ways and means must be found to enable us to obtain the capital necessary to make full use of the new techniques from which we are benefiting. I am making no plea for a land and agriculture bank or for cheap money. The history of land and agriculture banks in those countries where they have been founded has not been very happy, and cheap credit is merely another subsidy. I suggest that, owing to the peculiarity of the set-up of British agriculture, the Government should consider whether or not they can come to some arrangement to make more capital available, not in the form of grants but merely in the form of credits to the producer. I do not believe that that would be too difficult. There are many ways; I suggest only one. I should have thought that it would be possible for the Government, in agreement with the banks, to come to an arrangement by which the banks would advance a sum of money on receipt of a certificate from the Minister, through the county agricultural executive committees, and that the Government should guarantee the banks against loss on the excess between what the banks would have loaned if no certificate had been issued and the figure on the certificate. This would be a simple way to do what I suggest, because we have the whole machinery set up and working at the moment. The county agricultural executive committees make assessments of this nature on many occasions in order to carry out Part II of the Agriculture Act, 1947. They would be the only people who would be able to give an opinion whether the capital required would improve the holding and enable more efficient production and whether the tenant would be a suitable person to make use of the new equipment. We know that there are means for farmers to draw creditâ€”the banks, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and many other sourcesâ€”but all the sources at present at our service  merely touch the fringe of the problem with which we are faced. No precedent would be created by the suggestion that loans to farmers should be supported or backed by public moneys, because, as we all know, under the 1947 Act, the smallholders on our local government smallholdings are in the very privileged position of being able to raise capital largely on their reputation far more than on their stock. Today we have heard a very familiar phrase across the Floor of the House. That phrase is, ""A long-term agricultural policy"". I have been hearing it, and using it, for the last thirty years, and the leaders of the industry, the economists; and politicians on both sides of the House have been searching conscientiously for such a policyâ€”a practical long-term policy for agriculture. It appears to me that that is as elusive a quarry as the Abominable Snowman. Many people have divergent views on both, and nobody has yet produced either. Although I hope that the Minister and all concerned will continue their efforts to find that elusive beastâ€”the long-term policy, not the Abominable Snowmanâ€”I press the Minister not to wait for a successful conclusion to that search but, as a matter of very great urgency, to devise some method that will enable the farmers to raise capital. That will enable full use to be made of the great experience and ability of our farmers, the great skill of our agricultural workers, the wonderful climatic conditions and the fine soil conditions from which we benefit, so that they can play a great part in the economic battle in which we are engaged. Agriculture, like all other industries, must be given the opportunity to retool. If it is given that opportunity its efficiency will be much greater.
