This Session of Parliament has maintained the old established custom and tradition in the indulgence which it has extended to all new Members making their maiden speeches. I feel sure, therefore, in making my first speech in the House from this Box, I can rely upon any indulgence which may be necessary. The Supplementary Estimate I am asking the Committee to approve is one of Â£255,090, the summary of which is clearly set out on page 19 of the Supplementary Estimate. The first item thereof is a relatively small amount in connection with artificial insemination, and Members of the Committee may remember that the sum of Â£10,000 was provided under this head in the original estimate to enable grants to  be made to approved organisations providing a service of artificial insemination for cattle. Research is going on, the practical application of this new method is going on, and I think everybody on both sides of the House is more or less of one opinion in regard to this matter. As Members of the Committee will know, specific statutory authority in connection with these activities on artificial insemination is presently before the House in a Bill which I anticipate we may reach perhaps to-morrow, with the indulgence of Members opposite. The second item of the Supplementary Estimate is for expenses in connection with former activities of the Commissioners for Special Areas. The House may remember under the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945, the Commissioners for the Special Areas have been wound up and the Treasury proposes to determine under Section 8 of that Act that the agreements entered into by the Commissioner with the Land Settlement Association, the Welsh Land Settlement Society and certain county councils should be transferred to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. The next item is one of settlement grants.
