I rise to support the Bill. Civic amenities is a subject about which I feel very strongly. I thank the right hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys) for introducing the Bill and commend his work far the Civic Trust. I represent the High Peak division of Derbyshire and claim the distinction of being its first Labour Member of Parliament. Like my predecessor, Mr. David Walder, I represent the radical wing of my party. In January, in defence of one of his colleagues, Mr. Walder went on record in these words: I am sure that the public prefers a party that can bear criticism, to the monolith of yes-men, sinking their own differences to hang on to power â€¦ These are sentiments which I entirely endorse. In conclusion on this note, I wish Mr. Walder well in his future career. I have said that I represent the High Peak division of Derbyshire. Within my constituency lies a considerable section of the Peak District National Park. This is an area of outstanding natural beauty. I hope that it will long remain so. I am pleased to commend the Bill, which I believe will contribute to this. I could comment on all three parts of the Bill, but I wish to confine myself to Part III, which is concerned with the  disposal of vehicles and rubbish. This part of the Bill makes it an offence to abandon a vehicle or deposit rubbish, and it increased the fines which can be imposed on offenders. This is a special problem in the Peak District. Moving cars are an intrusion in the countryside in any case. Cars are an even greater disfigurement when they are abandoned. I have seen figures which suggest that 1 million cars are abandoned each year. I think we all agree that this is a problem which is now with us. We should turn our minds to the problem which will be with us in the future. I extract the following figures from the Buchanan Report. Buchanan suggests that the number of vehicles on the road at present is 10Â½ million. He projects that this number will increase to 18 million by 1970, to 27 million by 1980, and to 40 million by 2,010. This represents a doubling of numbers within 10 years and a trebling within 20. It is important to note that nearly half the total increase is expected within the next 10 years. To date, this problem has been dealt with in a fairly haphazard way. I commend a recent article in The Times on the problem of abandoned vehicles. I learned from this article that there are certain periods in the year, depending on the price of non-ferrous and ferrous metals, when it just is not economically worthwhile to ""scrap"" a vehicle, so scrap dealers are very reluctant to take vehicles for scrap. Local authorities, following the excellent circular published by the Minister in February, 1965, are also taking action. It appears from what I have read that their practices vary. Some local authorities charge. Some do not. Charging acts as a deterrent. I am glad that the circular suggests that the service should be provided gratis. I gather from figures which have been published by Liverpool that since that city provided a free service the number of cars passed over to the authority for destruction has increased eight-fold. Clause 15 empowers local authorities to act jointly. This is a very important Clause, because it will allow local authorities, acting jointly, to make use of the new disposal techniques. I should like to refer to two of these. I gather that the   Bird Company has introduced into this country a mobile car crusher. I am told that it costs Â£65,000 and that after initial preparation it has a capacity of 30 cars an hour. It is obvious that it would not be economical for one local authority to buy one of these mobile car crushers. It would have to be done by a consortium of local authorities, and this would be possible under this Clause. I understand that the Cohen 600 Group has introduced a revolutionary technique or is in the process of doing so, which is referred to as the Proler process. This is an even more expensive piece of machinery. I gather that one of these plants will be introduced into the South-East and that the cost will be Â£1 million. Clearly, it is doubtful whether an enterprise on this scale could be financed by local authorities, but, from what I read of this process, this is the most effective way of dealing with the problem. The capacity of this plant is 400,000 cars a year. I am told that the present rate of scrapping in the South-East is 175,000 a year. Therefore, when this plant is laid down it can obviously cope adequately with all the cars in the South-East which need to be scrapped now and in the next decade. I should like local authorities and the Government to take this matter seriously. I should like encouragement to be given to local authorities to form a consortium in all parts of the country and to invest in this kind of plant. Probably they would require financial support from the Government. This would save land use. A previous speaker mentioned the problem that some authorities have of providing space for dumping cars. If we could have these central sites we could economise in land usage. There are, of course, problems involved. If we had four or five of these plants in the country, local authorities would have the problem of getting the cars to the sites. Obviously, this would be fairly expensive. Some of the cars which are abandonedâ€”I can think of several in my own constituencyâ€”are without wheels. One only has to consider the cost involved in taking an abandoned car without wheels a distance of 30 or 40 miles to realise that this can be a very expensive business. I also gather that local authorities, when they deal with this problem, meet considerable administrative costs and I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a recent statement by a local authority spokesman who said: The real cost and major difficulty in dealing with abandoned cars is the vast administrative problem involved. We have to try to trace each car owner and check that no hire-purchase payments are still owing. One private agency does nothing but check on this sort of thing for us. There have been cases where councils were sued by hire-purchase dealers because they disposed of the car before full payments had been made. I should like an assurance that local authorities will not be required to undertake the kind of administrative work in which they have been involved in the past. In conclusion, I should like to commend an idea which occurred to me independently but which I find has already been canvassed by Lord Redesdale. That is an additional tax for scrapping. He has proposed that each new car should carry a Â£5 surtax, and I think this would have much to commend it. A person buying a new car would pay Â£5, and when the car was due 'to be scrapped the person taking the car to the destructor unit would receive Â£5. This would provide a very considerable incentive to car owners to dispose of their vehicles. At the moment, they have no incentive; in fact, there is a positive deterrent. Some authorities charge; some do not. If we were to provide this incentive to scrap cars, we would save a lot of expense which might otherwise be involved. For example, we would save the expense of taking cars long distances. They would be taken by the owners with the log book and they would receive Â£5. Many of these problems could be solved by this tax, and I commend the idea to the Minister.
