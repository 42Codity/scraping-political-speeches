It is an honour to follow the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg). I wonder whether he attended any of the banquets he spoke of with previous champions. Just a few weeks into this parliamentary term, I had the pleasure of discussing with a right hon. Member of the Conservative party how the Scottish National party Members were being received by other Members of the House. He advised somewhat humorously, â€œLabour loathe you.â€ Naturally, I went on to inquire how his Conservative colleagues felt. With a wry smile he said, â€œWe loathe you less.â€ I therefore take this opportunity to commend my SNP colleagues for a most auspicious start to our collective parliamentary careers. On a more serious note, I hope the message that SNP Members have sentâ€”that we are here to work constructively and positively with any progressive Member of this House for the betterment of all within these islandsâ€”is being received. Although we work first and foremost for our constituents, we are also aware that the social democracy practised in Scotland would be of great benefit to the majority of the people of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and we actively seek to create an effective and cohesive opposition along those lines. I am honoured to have been elected to represent the people of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. It is a burgh constituency, and although many have claimed theirs to be the most beautiful in the land, and although we have no shortage of beauty spots, such as Drumpellier country park and the under-siege Douglas glen, I cannot make that claim for my constituency, given the decades of neglect that our once heavily industrialised heartland has suffered. Rather, what we most value is our people. Our people are resilient, honest and resourceful, although far too many of us have had no choice but to leave to find work elsewhere in these lands. It has been that way for decades, and we deserve better. I am happy to inform the House that my predecessor is well. Having dined with him only last week, I will pass on the message that he sends his â€œwarmest regards to all Members of both Houses of Parliament past and presentâ€. That is from Tom Clarke, and it is befitting of a gentleman, as I am sure all Members agree. I am sure that they will all join me in wishing Tom all the very best in whatever future endeavours he takes up. In voting so emphatically for the SNP, Scotland has voted for anti-austerity; free education; an NHS protected from privatisation; balanced booksâ€”something you ought to try down here one of these yearsâ€”an anti-nuclear stance; and an inclusive, tolerant society that has social and economic justice at its heart, instead of the right-wing neo-liberalism we see from the two main establishment parties of this House. This failure is serious, harsh and oft-times leads to absolute despair. With the additional cuts announced today, I fear for the wellbeing for many of my constituents and those of many other Members. Dark times are indeed ahead, especially as these cuts will see the further decimation of an already overstretched and struggling social security system. That darkness can often lead to the loss of all hope and ultimately to something much more sinister, suicide. It came as a real, hard shock to me to learn that suicide is the biggest cause of death in Scotland for people aged 14 to 35, with three times as many young men taking their own lives as women, usually by very violent means. When we on the SNP Benches plead with the Government to stay the hand that cuts, it is not just because it does not work and never has; it is also to protect those who will suffer most, the vulnerable in our society. How terrible that suffering is when a loved one is so stretched that they are driven to take their own life. Thankfully, there are good folk around, particularly one Anne Rowan who has set up Chrisâ€™s House in my home constituency town of Coatbridge. Chris stands for the Centre for Help Respite Intervention Surrounding Suicide, and Chrisâ€™s House is a 24-hour service dedicated to engaging with people in distress, the first to be set up in Scotland, so that there will always be hope. It is a new charity I am proud and humble to be patron of. What of hope? What is the difference between aspiration and hope? I hear many in these Chambers use the words â€œaspirationâ€ and â€œaspirationalâ€. When we compare the modern definitions, the none too subtle difference is clear. Aspirational means: â€œHaving or characterised by aspirations to achieve social prestige and material successâ€, versus hope, which means: â€œGrounds for believing that something good may happen.â€ People have hope for the future not just for themselves but for others. In Scotland, although we are not without aspiration, it is with hope that we look to the future for all those who live and work in Scotland. We, the 56, have been sent south with a unique mandate to do our best by those who believe more in hope for all than in material aspiration exclusively for the few. What we now see in Scotland is a people awakened to politics. Glib soundbites no longer cut it, as all the establishment parties should now realise. The now infamous promise of home rule, near-federalism and devo to the max was pivotal in giving this House one more chance to give Scotland the powers it voted for and to get it right. Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to believe that this House understands Scotland and its people. Of course, we ourselves have been wrestling with the idea of the Caledonian antisyzygy since the early 1900s. This very Scottish dichotomy needs at least to be considered, if not fully understood, if Members want to understand what we, the people of Scotland, are, what we believe in and what we voted for. A few weeks ago, the Secretary of State for Scotlandâ€”I see he is no longer in his placeâ€”stated that there was â€œno empirical evidenceâ€ that the now infamous vow affected the vote in the Scottish referendum last year. I direct him to Lord Ashcroft's exit poll on the question about the â€œmost important reasonsâ€ for voting no by percentage of no voters, which shows that 25% of no votersâ€”14% of the electorateâ€”stated that the main reason was: â€œA NO vote would still mean extra powers for the Scottish Parliament together with the security of remaining part of the UK, giving the best of both worldsâ€. I am, of course, happy to furnish the Secretary of State with this empirical evidence that was so hard to find. This darkness of cuts and social deprivation can be found mostly in the lives of the poor souls affected but also in the soulless lives of those who would impose such evils on the most vulnerable in our society. Where is the empathy? What mattersâ€”materialism or people? Members of this House would be wise to take heed of the words of Scotland's national bard and to understand that people come before profit. After all: â€œThe rank is but the guineaâ€™s stamp The manâ€™s the gowd for aâ€™ thatâ€. That is something that we would all do well to remember in both Houses of this Parliament. SlÃ inte, Madam Deputy Speaker.
