I ask for the indulgence which this House traditionally accords to a new Member making his first speech. I shall not detain hon. Members long but I should like to say before starting that my reason for choosing this particular occasion for speaking is that in my small way I have, perhaps, a little knowledge and experience of these high matters. As a Reservist and as a wartime rating and, subsequently, as a commissioned officer in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, the future welfare and well-being of the Navy are very close to my heart. I have listened with the greatest attention to the Debate on these matters and   it is perfectly clear that there is no deep cleavage of opinion between one side of the House and the other on the question of the steps immediately to be taken. We all realise that a certain amount of money is available for spending and that it is up to us to try to spend it in the most ingenious and thrifty manner possible. The only real differences between us lie in questions of emphasis and whether we are laying the right emphasis on the right things. The two points which, at least to me, have emerged from the Debate were the anxiety expressed on both sides, firstly, on the question of manpower and reserves and, secondly, on the question of the adequacy or otherwise of our preparations to meet the submarine menace, which, everybody seems to be agreed, is the greatest purely naval problem which is likely to confront our strategists in any future war. I wish to make a small point on the question of naval recruitment and reserves. I have heard only one other hon. Member, my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Chelsea (Commander Noble), refer to the Sea Cadets. In this organisation we have a very good recruiting ground for the Navy, but at present, unfortunately, boys who join the organisation do not necessarily find their way into the Navy as a result of their early keenness. At a time when, with all due respect to the hon. and gallant Member for Hull, East (Commander Pursey), there is a little anxiety about recruitment, it is a pity to do anything which discourages a volunteer from choosing the Service he would like to join. I am not suggesting that it should be made possible for every sea cadet automatically to do his National Service in the Navy. We do not ask that because, if that were done, inevitably there would be a considerable element joining the Sea Cadet Corps for no other reason than that they would rather serve in the Navy than in the Army, or Air Force. But, if it could be arrangedâ€”I do not think it would be a matter requiring a great deal of money, or even great administrative inconvenienceâ€”for those boys who have proved themselves to be reasonably assured when the time of their call-up came that they could serve their time in the Service of their choice, it would be one of those small things, small in them-  selves, but which, taken with other expedients, would help immeasurably in recruitment. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of that. I know it is true that boys on achieving the age of 18, if they choose to join the R.N.V.R., may serve in the Navy, but the sea cadet organisation is a much more local affair and it is not always possible for a sea cadet to join the R.N.V.R. He may be a keen lad and it is a pity to have to say goodbye to him because he feels that if he stays where he is he may not get into the Navy. The morale of those who give their time to train these boys will be enormously fortified if they feel that they are training them for the Service of their choice. At present retired officers, petty officers and ratings who are doing this job often feel that they are giving up their time in order that their charges may eventually go into the Army, or the Air Force. On the question of the adequacy of our preparations in the submarine menace we have heard much. The point has frequently been made, and there seems to be agreement, that the small type of standardised, rapidly produced, aircraft carrier, built in large numbers and properly equipped, is the answer to the problem rather than a much smaller number of large, costly and vulnerable, fleet carriers. I think that was the substance of the view put forward by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Captain Ryder) and other hon. and gallant Members. Speaking with a little operational experience of both Fleet and escort carriers in the last war, I think we should be very careful that we do not incur the reproach so often levelled at us of making ready for the next war by consulting the drill books of the last war. It occurred to me during the last war, when in effect we and the Americans attempted to create a large fleet of these small carriers, that their use then was purely transitional and we were having to use them then because we were so limited as to the bases from which aircraft could operate, particularly in the Pacific and also because at that time we had not sufficient properly equipped very long-range aircraft. If our present system of alliances with our American and Western Union friends means anything, surely the question of   bases is very much better than it was before and throughout the world we should be able to operate very long-range aircraft from places which we were never able to use before. There is also the increasing complexity of modern naval aircraft. It is such that with all the ""gadgetry"" they have to carry it will not be possible to cram all this technical paraphernalia into the sort of small machine which could be operated efficiently from escort carriers. This technical question of everything getting bigger and more complicated is a factor which will make it very difficult to provide floating bases for this type of aircraft. I do not discount air power, but I think that the future in this matter of combating the submarine menace is going to be the operation from shore bases of very long-range aircraft and the carriers on which we were depending at the end of the last war will take a back seat because they were essentially a transitional force. In combating the submarines themselves, there will be the question of the Navy providing highly specialised craft and the Air Force providing very long-range aircraft operating from a chain of bases, of course, in the closest co-operation with the Royal Navy. That is only a thought, but I hope that when we come to hammer out these things it will not necessarily be assumed that because the aircraft carrier rose to the zenith of its power at the end of the last war, those conditions will repeat themselves. I do not think they will. I have made the two points I wished to make and, unlike many politicians, I now propose to resume my seat. Before doing so, I wish to thank the House for the indulgence they have granted me and to say, speaking as a ""new boy,"" that I am most grateful for the many kindnesses and courtesies I have had from all hon. Members. Those kindnesses and courtesies have been by no means confined to hon. Members on this side of the House.
