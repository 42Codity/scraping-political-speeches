I hope hon. Members will not feel that a second maiden speech in one day imposes too much of a trial on their kindness. I ask them to be indulgent to me for a few minutes. There were a number of points in the speech of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Park (Mr. Mulley) with which I would heartily agree, and I shall probably touch on one or two of them in my speech. One of the most encouraging things which has happened since the warâ€”in this there are hon. Members on both sides of the House who would probably agreeâ€”is the progress, gradual it is true, that we have seen in the movement towards co-operation both political and economic in Europe. We have seen a gradual movement towards the liberalisation of trade. We have seen an increasing realisation that most of the nation States of Europe, standing by themselves in the shadow of two great Powers to the East and to the West of them, are individually too small and too insecure, both politically and economically, to pursue their own policies entirely alone. Political unity has seemed more important to Continental nations than to ourselves, simply because we have the added security and confidence of our overseas members of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, I think most hon. Members would agree that economically we have been able to play a very big part in the work of O.E.E.C. Now we come to a stage at which both the political and economic movements show some signs of fusion. The nations which have met in the Messina Conference have formed plans which look like the beginnings of the next step forward covering both the political and to some extent the   economic field. At this moment we are faced with a decision; what should we do? Are we to go in and throw overboard to some extent some of our ties with our overseas possessions? Should we stay out and fade away from the co-operation which we have had with Continental nations in the economic field? Or can we find some other proposal which would meet with the approval both of the Commonwealth and the members of O.E.E.C.? If I understood the line of his speech, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Parkâ€”like the right hon. Member for Huyton (Mr. H. Wilson)â€”was, broadly speaking, in agreement with the proposals of the Government to try to find a common ground on which to do those two things. I welcome what my right hon. Friend has said today about trying to find some way which would enable us to enter into what we might call a partially free-trading area in Europe while at the same time enabling us to preserve our ties with the Commonwealth. I welcome that for two reasons. First, because I think that this European free-trade area offers great opportunities, and, let us face it, great challenges to British industry. Secondly, I welcome it because I believe that if this common market went forward without us it would present great dangers to us. I wish to remind the House of two simple figures of which hon. Members will be well aware. They are the figure of our population, 51 million, and the size of the total population of the Messina countries, which is about 162 million; and the size of our national income, about 43,000 million dollars, and the size of theirs, which is about twice that figure. If we went into that grouping, we should be part of an economic association comparable in size with the United States. If, as was suggested by my right hon. Friend, more O.E.E.C. countries joined with us in the scheme, we should be even greater than that, and comparable in size with Soviet Russia as well. As I said earlier, this proposal presents difficulties, but, on those figures alone, I believe it provides enormous advantages which deserve careful examination. I believe that the advantages which we can get as manufacturers and, if I may  stress it, as retailers and purveyors of goods and services, and as consumers, may very wellâ€”in my mind willâ€”outweigh any difficulties and challenges that British industry will have to face. Now I would say a word or two about the dangers that might face us if the scheme went forward without us. It would be a pretty bleak prospect for us. I think I am right in saying that we sell about 17 per cent. of our exports to the Messina countries. If the common market came into being without us, we should be faced with a tariff wall against us at the time when the member countries of the common market would be selling among each other tariff-free. That would not help our exports. In other overseas markets, outside the common-market area, we should be working against the background of a home market of 50 million people while they would be working to a home market of 160 million. That would have its effect on our ability to compete with those countries in other markets than the common market. Thirdly, we should not be too confident about turning our backs upon Europe and concentrating upon our traditional primary-producer countries, because the figures are not all that encouraging, if I read them aright. I understand that imports to the overseas markets in the sterling area actually fell in the period 1951â€“55. In that same period, imports from the Messina group countries rose by about 50 per cent. The point that I believe this makes is that we would be in danger, if we turned our backs upon Europe and concentrated upon our traditional markets, of turning towards a market which is going to expand at a slower rate than the rate of expansion of European markets. We should be, competitively, facing a period in which we should grow at a slower rate than our European competitors. That might easily mean a decline in our standard of living, with all that would follow from that. It would also mean less money available for investment in many other parts of the world. Next I come to the question how we should enter this group. Many of us on this side of the House will find it extremely difficult to support this scheme, for all its advantages, if it does not contain the provisions which the Chancellor   mentioned this afternoon for the exclusion of agricultural produce, feeding stuffs and raw materials. I say this with particular reference to my own constituency. In Tonbridge and round about are many people whose livelihood comes directly or indirectly from agriculture, and there are many other people who have worked at some time or another in British territories overseas and have very great loyalties to those parts of the world. Both those groups will be glad of the conditions that the Chancellor of the Exchequer put forward for entry into this scheme. The agricultural point of view is completely covered in the guarantees which my right hon. Friend gave. Secondly, there would be a worse prospect if the scheme meant any weakening of Commonwealth ties. From the figures that we have had today, I understand that about 90 per cent. of our trade with the Commonwealth comes under the agricultural raw material exemption. By no means all of the remaining 10 per cent. is in direct competition with European produce. Thirdly, all Commonwealth goods will continue to enjoy their existing preferences in this country against non-European goods. Even so, many of us would be extremely worried if a deliberate act of policy reduced by even 5 per cent. our Commonwealth trade if there were no compensating advantages to be set against that. I think there are compensating advantages which will make the Commonwealth very largely sympathetic towards the move which my right hon. Friend proposes to make. In the first place, there is a recognition all over the Commonwealth that this country can only play her part in the world and in the development of the Commonwealth if she is prosperous. If the scheme is good for British trade, it is likely for that reason to be good for the Commonwealth. Secondlyâ€”I hope the Commonwealth realises thisâ€”Britain has a large part to play in Europe on behalf of the Commonwealth. I believe that a great deal of our Commonwealth thinking has taken a turn towards regional grouping and areas of responsibility, with no loss to the strength of the Commonwealth. I do not believe that the strength of the Commonwealth, or the loyalty of  Canada to the Commonwealth, has suffered because a great deal of Canada's trade is with the United States. If that is good for her strength, it is good for the Commonwealth as a whole, and it provides important links between us and the United States. It was a perfectly natural and logical decision for Australia and New Zealand to take upon themselves in the Anzus Pact on behalf of the Commonwealth the defence of the Pacific. In that sort of way they would understand that Britain and Europe, both geographically and diplomatically, are linked together; they would understand this movement towards co-operation. I welcome these proposals. I believe they are a valuable challenge to and a valuable opportunity for British industry. They will enable us to play our part in the next steps of further co-operation in Europe, and to retain our ties and loyalties to the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will be able to go forward enthusiastically into these negotiations. It is terribly important at the present time that Europe should think that we are genuinely and honestly behind this desire for co-operation among us all.
