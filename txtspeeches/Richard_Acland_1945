I am sure the right hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. C. Davies) will excuse me if I postpone for a moment taking him up on one point, that in which he said that the difficulty of raising our exports to prewar level was primarily due to the raising of barriers, of nationalism, all over the world. I hope later to offer him a rather different explanation; but I postpone that, because I should like to begin with one comment on the speech of the right hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton). I know that the days have long since gone by when hon. Members of this House made their speeches almost entirely in quotations from the Greek and Latin classics strung together with a few words in Anglo-Saxon. Nor would I wish to pose as a classical scholar, but when I heard the right hon. Gentleman castigating various Ministers on this side of the Houseâ€”and, indeed, when I have recently read speeches from other right hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition Front Benchâ€”I am most forcibly reminded of one of the very few Latin phrases I know, which was, I think, applied by Cicero to the Emperor  Neroâ€”and if it was not Cicero and Nero, it must have been two other Romansâ€”â€”
