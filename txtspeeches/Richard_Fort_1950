With your permission, Sir, I should like to make the following statement. Sir Alan Rae Smith has been examining the costs of running taxis in London with a view to advising me whether any revision of the present fare system should be made as there has been no increase in these fares since 1933. I have asked Sir Alan Rae Smith for a special interim report on the increase in the fares which might be justified by the increased tax on petrol. Sir Alan Rae Smith has said that the increased cost to be attributed to this source would be met by an increase of 3d. on the fare for each completed journey. Acting on this advice I have decided to make an Order, as an interim measure, authorising such an increase in the Metropolitan Police district as from Sunday midnight.
