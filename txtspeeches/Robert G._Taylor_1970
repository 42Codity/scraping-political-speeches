I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time. Perhaps the most dangerous words to use in the House of Commons are, ""This is a non-controversial Bill."" I hope that they will be justified on this occasion and that we shall not detain the House unduly long. It may be recalled that this Bill was lost on the dissolution of the previous Parliament. It was introduced at the end of April, and on 5th May the consideration of principle was taken in the Scottish Grand Committee, where it received all-party support. On 12th May, in the Scottish Standing Committee, the Bill completed the Committee stage without amendment and virtually without debateâ€”which must, indeed, be a record for the Scottish Standing Committee. The Bill is a simple one. Its purpose is to empower the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring employers to deduct from the salaries of persons employed by them who are registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland the fee payable to the council for renewal of registration. This requirement operates only where registration is a statutory requirement of the person's employmentâ€”for example, as a teacher in an education authority or a grant-aided school. On deduction of the fee, the employer is required to remit it to the council. The text of the Bill is identical with that of the Bill introduced in the previous Parliament, apart from two minor changes. One is a drafting amendment and the other an omission. I can assure the House that neither affects the intention of the Bill in any way. In those circumstances, I commend the Bill to the House.
