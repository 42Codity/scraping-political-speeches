Like three previous hon. Members who have addressed the House this afternoon for the first time, I would like to crave the indulgence of the House on speaking in it on the first occasion. In fact, I would not have ventured to do so, particularly in view of the advice I have received from many senior Members in the last week or so not to make a maiden speech in a hurry unless one has a great urge to do so, had I not desired to refer to a certain section of the Gracious Speech. That is why I venture to say a few words this afternoon. That section is the one addressed to Members of this House only, which warns us that we shall be asked to approve orders making certain changes in the Customs tariff arising from the agreement concluded at the Annecy Conference last summer. The reason I refer to that section of the Gracious Speech is that I do not like the results of the Annecy Conference, because those orders resulting from it can only mean one thingâ€”further reductions in the margin of tariff preferences which Britain grants to Empire countries on most of their produce and manufactures. It is quite true that those reductions, or most of them, may not in themselves be of very great importance. In fact, I think the most important subjects on which these preferences are to be reduced are cod liver oil, blue veined cheese and unwrought aluminium. I think I am right in saying that in the case of unwrought aluminium it is to be abolished altogther. To my mind, that is a very unwise measure from this point of view, that it is being done at the request of Norway and at the expense of Canada. It is an unwise policy for us to take a step which may result in our depending more on a foreign country like Norway for our supplies of aluminium and less on one of our own Dominions, particularly a Dominion like Canada, which had to come to our rescue in 1940 when supplies from all parts of Western Europe were cut off. Apart from that, this is also a very vital question of principle, and I do not want any legislation which will whittle down still further our existing preferential system. Furthermore, the conference at Annecy has resulted in our giving undertakings to bind certain Customs duties on other commodities at existing rates. For instance, we have agreed to bind the duty of 2s. per cwt. on dried currants. We have agreed to bind a 10 per cent. Customs Duty on tomatoes, a 15 per cent. Customs Duty on cheese, and a 15s. per cwt. Customs Duty on butter. That might mean, in the case of butter, that if Denmark, for example, succeeded in producing butter at more than a penny a pound cheaper than New Zealand, she might succeed in squeezing New Zealand butter out of the British market. This retrograde policy, as I cannot help calling it, began as the result of the American Loan Agreement in 1945, when we agreed to consider proposals for the reduction and the eventual elimination of Imperial Preference. The policy was put into operation, first of all, at Geneva in the summer of 1947. The theory behind it, which is one of complete nondiscrimination in international trade, was also agreed to at Geneva in the draft trade charter produced in 1947. That charter was put into its final form at Havana in the winter of 1947â€“48, and another step in this policy was taken at the conference of Annecy last summer. We are now threatened with a further international conference, this time at Torquay. I make no complaint about holding any international conference at Torquay, or anywhere else on British soil. Not only will that bring us some valuable foreign exchange, but it will give our people a better opportunity of being told what is going on at this conference than they would have if it were held on foreign soil. It is rather curious that they should always choose very desirable watering places for conferences of this kind, first of all Geneva, then Havana, then Annecy and now Torquay. At the risk of offending one or two hon. Members opposite, I sometimes wonder whether, if places like Wigan or Gateshead were chosen, it might not speed up the negotiations, particularly if the delegates had to live in Nissen huts or other  unpleasant accommodation, as some of our people have to do. I attended the Geneva conference several times as a spectator in the summer of 1947. I was present at the plenary session which adopted the draft trade charter. I have never seen less enthusiasm for any proposal than was shown at that session. The whole charter, with the system which it proposes to introduce, is really a piece of humbug which can never be put in practice in full. The conference practically ignored the result of further reductions in our tariff preferences. A letter has already been sent out to organisations like the Federation of British Industries asking for their views on items which might concern them. We have also been warned that there will be reductions in the margins of preference at present accorded by other Commonwealth countries to the United Kingdom on United Kingdom goods. I shudder to think of the effect of any more reductions on that account. I believe one hon. Member mentioned Japan in the course of this Debate. What is going to happen if we abolish this system of Empire preference and if in due course we suffer from increased competition from Japan? What is going to happen to British goods in Dominion markets if we cannot get the tariff preferences we get at present? Economically this is a policy of complete madness. If carried to the end aimed at by American proposals, which are really behind it, it will lead to nothing less than the economic break-up of the British Empire. I should like to see any future conference held on this question, not as an international conference to bring about further reductions in Empire preference, but as an Empire economic conference to plan our Empire trade and our system of Imperial Preference in the light of post-war conditions. If we are to survive as an Empire, we must be free to regulate our Empire trade as we think fit. We must therefore rid ourselves of these obligations, entered into since the war, to reduce and whittle down and eventually abolish our Empire preference system and all these conditions under which we have agreed to bind existing Customs duties at their present rate. Not until we do that, and we get back to   the atmosphere of Ottawa of 1932, shall we set ourselves an the road to recovery, and on the way to making the Empire a prosperous organisation, as it was before the war.
