My Department, both centrally and through the Essex Agricultural Executive Committee, maintains close liaison with the War Office and the Ministry of Supply to ensure that this agricultural land is put to the best possible agricultural use consistent with the essential requirements of the latter Department, to whom the Island has been made available for experimental purposes. I am satisfied that in the existing circumstances the Island is producing as much food as is practicable.
