I welcome my first opportunity to address the House, and, in passing, I express my thanks to the people of Newport who sent me here. From time to time there is controversy on the question whether my constituency lies in England or Wales. In view of the fact that maiden speeches tend to be non-controversial it may be appropriate if I describe Newport as being situated in the ancient Kingdom of Gwent. What is beyond dispute is the fact that Newport possesses the premier Rugby team in Wales, despite any reservations my right hon. Friend the Chancellor may have on the subject. On a personal note, I recall a train journey that I made a few weeks ago. I entered a compartment which was occupied by an hon. Lady who sits on the benches opposite. After we had exchanged the usual pleasantries, she said, ""Are you a lecturer?"" I said, ""Oh, no, I am one of those dreadful trade unionists."" Needless to say, after that we had a most interesting conversation. The right hon. and learned Gentleman who preceded me as Member for Newport, Sir Frank Soskice, played a most distinguished part in the affairs of the House. I am very privileged indeed to succeed him. He was popular in the constituency and most kind to me personally. I know that hon. Members on both sides will join me in congratulating him upon his recent honour and will welcome him back to Westminster in another place.
