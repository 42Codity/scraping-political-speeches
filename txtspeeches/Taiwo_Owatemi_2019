Last month, a young man from my constituency was fatally stabbed, and just this weekend another  young man was stabbed in Coventry. Violent crime in the city is rising, yet I only have 10 police officers in my constituency, some of whom I share with my Coventry colleagues. As the Prime Minister makes such a big deal about his 20,000 new police officers, can he tell my constituents whether we are going to get our fair share?
