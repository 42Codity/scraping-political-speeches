No one can possibly rise for the first time in the House without some feeling of awe and without being at least a little apprehensive. I think that this is especially so when, as now, a new Member is rising during a somewhat controversial debate. I shall fully understand if any hon. Member feels that anything I say cannot pass without immediate comment. I had hoped that I would be making my maiden speech after the General Election, because I hoped that my predecessor, Mr. Percy Wells, might have been in the House to have heard it. I think it true to say that Percy Wells has been held in very high regard by hon. Members on both sides of the House, and, I think, not only ill high regard but also with some affection. I think that that is even rarer. There is no doubt at all, as we in the Faversham constituency know, that he fought very hard for his constituents. Right from the early days after the First World War he fought for the farm workers, and I can remember him telling us of negotiations in which he engaged in which farm workers wages were raised to 9d. an hour. He worked until the end as a member of the Central Agricultural Wages Board and   took part in the negotiations for the last rise agreed not so long ago. I must say, too, that I consider myself fortunate to have had the benefit of spending 2Â½ years with him and the benefit of his guidance during this time. I think, therefore, that it is appropriate that as his successor I should speak first on agriculture. Percy Wells had also a keen sense of humour, so that I do not think that he would mind if I were to try to establish my right to speak on farming policy by a lighter reference to the Faversham by-election. Hon. Members will remember that the by-election was fought the day after Derby Day. Two days before polling day my principal opponent was rash enough to describe me as the Santa Claus of Faversham. I am not a racing man, but I understand that Santa Claus did win the Derby, and this has left me with an even greater love of animals than I had before and, therefore, a greater desire to speak about agricultural matters. Last week also provided an almost irresistible desire to speak for the very same reason in the debate on sport and leisure, and in view of the fact that Santa Claus was an Irish horse it almost persuaded me to speak in the international affairs debate as well. But there is another reason which provided equal grounds for seeking to speak in that debate and this one and that is an interest in Commonwealth agriculture. This is partly because of a close Australian family tie. When speaking in the House about people outside Parliament one has to speak very carefully, but in fact my closest supporter not only campaigned and cooked for me but voted for me as well, a combination that requires remarkable devotion. She happens to be an Australian, and was described by one Sunday newspaper during the by-election as ""Labour's Secret Weapon"". I can only say that this is one Anglo-Australian venture which got off the launching pad the first time. However, to come to more serious matters facing the House, the Faversham constituency is one of just a handful of Labour held constituencies in which the farm vote has been very influential. One of the main points upon which I should like to dwell this afternoon is the need  to relate farming policy more closely to land policy. In spite of improved techniques which have made land more economical, I think it is true to say that there is a growing shortage of valuable farm land, especially in the South of England, and I think it is important to save as much of this land as possible. It has been said on one occasion that the onus of proof when deciding to use agricultural land for other purposes, as put forward by the Scatt Committee on land utilisation, was that potential alternative users should have to prove that it was in the national interest to use the land for agricultural purposes. but I think that usually the custom since then has been that the agricultural user must prove that it is needed for agricultural purposes rather than the other way round. While I think that that is the right onus of proof and the one most commonly followed, I think it is also essential that the agricultural owner gets a fair hearing, but sometimes he does not. It is essential to protect this valuable agricultural land and this is one reason why we in Faversham have been so very disappointed as have others in other parts of Kent that the Isle of Sheppey was left out of the South-East Plan. This affects hon. Members on both sides of the House and people outside the House. The Isle of Sheppey was not even mentioned in the Government's South-East Study. This is an area where there is ample land for industrial and housing development purposes without ruining some of the valuable horticultural and agricultural land in other parts of the area, especially in the Sittingbourne and Faversham districts. During the past six or seven weeks some hon. Members on both sides of the House have had an opportunity to find out just where the Isle of Sheppey is, and other hon. Members on both sides of the House have probably also found out not only where it is on the map but that it is on the map. I realise that this matter is not a direct responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture, but I hope he may use his influence with his right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government to bring to his attention the fact that there is land available on the Isle of Sheppey which by being used for industrial and housing purposes would keep valuable horticultural and   agricultural land in other parts of Kent much freer from the pressure exercised upon it at the moment. I say, too, that the Government owe a duty to the Isle of Sheppey to bring more industrial development there, because the unemployment level has remained around the 6 per cent. mark ever since the closure of the dockyard. I do not intend to dwell upon this matter more this afternoon but rather on the less controversial aspects. I think it is agreed by local people on all sides that there is a need to protect farmland. It was stated in the Kent Development Plan in the paragraph headed ""Major urban areas which, from an agricultural standpoint can be expanded"" that the Sheerness, Queenborough and Minister area could be developed to the south, south-east and south-west. It also said in the paragraph headed ""Major Urban Areas to whose expansion there is serious agricultural objection"" that these areas should not be expanded, Sittingbourne to the east, south and west and Faversham also to the east, south and west, where there is valuable agricultural land. With regard to the part of the plan concerned with agriculture particularly, it said that in the Sittingbourne and Milton vicinity no further material expansion â€¦ could easily be justified by a regional planning policy having regard to the very good agricultural land on the periphery of the town and the existence of other centres, such as Sheerness and the Lower Medway complex. It further said under a paragraph headed ""The North Kent Fruit Belt"": These advantages""â€” that is, the advantages of the landâ€” combine to make this the most favoured area in the country""â€” not simply in the county of Kent but in the countryâ€” for the production of tree fruit. Cherry and pear orchards predominate with small acreages of soft fruits, hops and market garden crops It is clearly in the national interest that â€¦ this unique area should be reserved, without qualification, for agriculture. I think that a substantial case has been made out for efforts to be made to see that the pressure is brought off the land in these areas and that the land on Sheppey should be used instead. It is true that this must go hand in hand with a policy to deal with land prices, which have the effect of increasing the  pressure on agricultural land, and it is something which we had a great deal to talk about on both sides in the by-election campaign. The way in which price increases have taken place in the area can be seen from one or two examples. There is the case of a house in the Sittingbourne area which was sold for Â£4,850 just over two years ago, and just over two months ago it was sold for Â£5,500â€”a tremendous increase in a short time. There is another plot of land in Sittingbourne which was bought for Â£6,000 and three years later, quite recently, it was sold for Â£0,000. In the nearby outskirts of the town there is a plot of land where barley is now growing. That land cost Â£1,000 an acre, four times the normal price for agricultural land. This shows that there is likely to be a growing pressure on the land in this area. It is true to say that not only in our area but in other areas as well many people pay a quarter of their incomes on mortgages, and it is not surprising, therefore, that people, for instance on our new estates, see some sense in the arguments which the Labour Party has been putting forward in connection with Labour's Crown Land Commission proposal to stabilise land prices. It may be going too far to say that these will bring down land prices, but certainly it is the one plan yet put forward which will have the effect of stabilising land prices. One other example which I should like to give concerns a farmer in my area who was saying how difficult it is to get hold of agricultural land. The wife of the farmer told me that they farm 100 acres, which is not a very large farm area, but their son is shortly completing his studies and they want to put him on the farm as well. Unfortunately, it is too small for an extra farmer to manage a complete section of the farm himself, and so they are anxious to get hold of an extra 50 acres. But this cannot be done at the moment. This is one example of the sort of shortages which farmers are finding. Here again the Labour Party's plan to relieve farmers, and perhaps especially the more elderly ones, from the burden of land which they cannot manage for one reason or another, by providing them with a good lump sum or an annuity to   be dealt with by an Agricultural Land Commission would help to remove the difficulty of land which is being held by farmers who do not really want it and so help to provide it for those who really do. I should like to mention one warning about the Agricultural Land Commission. Any land that it acquires, it must sell as soon as possible. This is essential. One other matter to which I should like to refer, and one which I have already mentioned, is that Faversham is a very large horticultural area. I have already mentioned cherries, apples, pears, peas and hops in another connection, and I dare say that some hon. Members might prefer hops to some of the other commodities. I should like to ask the Minister about the future of the apple and pear import quota. The Minister is expected to announce shortly the import quotas for next year, and I do not think there is any doubt that farmers are anxious to emphasise that this is the only way to protect top-fruit producers from competition from countries which are inherently capable of producing apples more cheaply than we can in view of our soil, climate and living conditions. A considerable number of people in my area have invested a great deal of money in production, storage and packing equipment associated with top-fruit, and I know that they would like to know what proposals the Government have for the long-term future of horticulture. In particular, anxiety is felt amongst the farming community over long-term arrangements. Whilst it is true that in their last agriculture and horticulture Measure the Government provided substantial sums to improve horticultural production and marketing, the question of the extent to which the industry might or might not be swamped with imports has been left open and very uncertain. A long-term assurance would be of extreme value to the farming community. There are many other problems connected with agriculture which we could discuss. The only other one to which I should like to refer is that to which my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Peart) has referred, and that is the need to get world food surpluses dealt  with as a matter of extreme urgency. This is a practical necessity and will be of great value to the developed and developing countries. Another important point is that it appeals to people's sense of idealism, and one cannot always say that about all the matters which are discussed either in this House or elsewhere. This is one of the fundamental problems and one of the biggest issues which will face the next Parliament. It is the duty of this Parliament to hold out hope for what will happen when the new Parliament is elected in October, and I hope that this will be one of the tasks which that Parliament will deal with enthusiastically. I may have touched upon some controversial matters in a maiden speech, and it may be unusual, but I think that the importance and value of Parliament is that Members can put forward their views and discuss their own policies sincerely. It is in this spirit, I hope, by putting forward my own views with sincerity, that I have tried to speak in this debate.
