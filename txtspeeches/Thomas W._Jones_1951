I hope I may have the indulgence of the House in addressing it for the first time. I should like to say how pleased I am to be called upon to speak on this dayâ€”a day devoted to dealing with the problems and the affairs of the country I love most. I am one of those people who believe that Wales is a nation. We have our own language, traditions, culture and customs, and unless this fact is unreservedly recognised I suggest that Members will never understand the people of Wales. Indeed, neither can we understand the problems   of Wales if we regard the Principality as merely an appendage to England. I could spend some time relating the contributions that Wales has made to western civilisation in literature, commerce, religion and politics. Indeed, during the present century Wales added lustre to the prestige of this House in the counsels of the nation by giving it one of the most illustrious and famous of Prime Ministers. Wales is described as the land of song. The Prime Minister, whom I trust is still pursuing his study of Welsh, quite correctly referred to it in my own tongueâ€”MÃ´r o gÃ¢n yw Cymru i gyd. I would, however, remind the House of the economic blizzard which raged like fury through the valleys of South Wales between the two wars. We still sang, it was true, but we sang in those days not because of the prevailing circumstances but in spite of them. The tragedy of that period has been expressed not in books, not in song, not in verse, but in the faces of brave men and women now turned middle age. We had every reason to hang our harps on the willows. The valleys were full of misery, degradation and distress. We are a forgiving people. We can forgive the cruelty of those days, but we can never forget them. How did the Government of that time endeavour to solve the problem? By forcing 250,000 of our people to leave their native land, the land of their fathers. As many as 250,000 of our young people had to leave. Exile and the breaking up of family life was what we experienced. Indeed, it was like a modern attempt to cure anaemia by a process of blood letting. It is because of our very sad experience that we appreciate this appointment which has been made by the Government, and I am quite prepared to congratulate the right hon. and learned Gentleman on his appointment as Minister for Welsh Affairs, and also his deputy, who unfortunately cannot be with us here today. I do not know whether there is any significance in their namesâ€”David and Llewellyn. We do know the blessing conferred upon Wales by St. David. We know the exploits on behalf of Wales by Prince Llewellyn. But then, of course, every David is not a saint, and every Llewellyn is not worthy to be a prince. I hope that these gentlemen will emulate them. His Majesty's Gracious Speech at the beginning of this Parliament included these words: I have approved new arrangements to bring added strength to the counsels of My Government upon the special problems and interests of Wales. It is fully recognised, therefore, in that speech that Wales has her special problems, and I want for a few minutes to deal with one of them in particular. I wish to refer to the problem of depopulation in the countryside. The mischief of this problem is this. Not only do we lose the population, but other things that we value greatly also go in its wake. The language goes. We also lose that peculiar form of Welsh culture known to us as Diwylliant Cefn Gwladâ€”that peculiar form of Welsh culture which is so highly valued in Wales. When we lose that, Wales loses her very soul. We were told in this House last week how the population of the world is increasing at an alarming rate. Today the population of England is higher than ever. The population of the Welsh countryside is declining in each succeeding year. Every year the population goes down and down. Let me give four examples from my own constituency of Merionethshire. During the last 20 years, the population of Edeyrnion rural district has declined by 11 per cent., that of Penllyn rural district by 21 per cent., that of Pennal parish by 15 per cent., and that of Deudraeth rural district by 4 per cent. Indeed, in a period of 30 years, the population of Penllyn and Edeyrnion, where we have this Diwylliant Cefn Gwlad that I spoke about, has lost 2,725 people. The population has decreased by that alarming number. The town of Blaenau Festiniog could once boast a population of 15,000; today, it is barely 8,000. The problem can only be solved in one, two or three waysâ€”by the expansion of existing industries, by the revival of old industries and by the establishment of new industries. May I be permitted to refer again to my own constituency of Merioneth? I naturally do so because it must be the best constituency in the Kingdom, but it is a typical North Wales county. What can be done there to check this tide of depopulation, which is the vital problem affecting Wales today? I have time only to touch upon perhaps two or three projects. I most strongly urge the Government to revive the coastal shipping in Cardigan Bay, and in this connection I have in mind the three ports of Barmouth, Aberdovey and Portmadoc in Caernarvonshire. Aberdoveyâ€”we have all heard of the bellsâ€”was once a flourishing port; indeed, even up to the last year before the war, it had a flourishing trade. The re-opening of these ports would also revive the fishing industry, and may I add, in case an emergency which I hope will never arise does come upon us, these ports could also be used for national defence. I also ask the Government to revive the woollen industry in North Wales. Merioneth is one of the principal wool-producing counties, not only in Wales, but in the whole of the Kingdom, and, therefore, has abundant supplies of raw material for a prosperous manufacture. The woollen industry in Dinas Mawddwyâ€”I do not know whether the right hon. and learned Gentleman saw it when he was in my constituency; he honoured us with his presence thereâ€”is a pattern which is worthy of the closest attention of the Government, and this factory was established for the very simple purpose of trying to stem the flow of depopulation. Years ago, too, there were throughout the length and breadth of Wales a large number of leather tanneries, and I am sure that these could be re-established with great profit, and that they would provide employment for hundreds of people. Lastly, the young people are leaving the countryside for another reason, which was touched upon by the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Finch)â€”the lack of social amenities. We are living in a scientific age, and it will be agreed that the basis of progress today is electricity. North Wales is very much underdeveloped in this respect. I blame no one for this; on the contrary, I wish here and now to pay a high tribute to the Merseyside and North Wales Electricity Board for what it has been able to accomplish in the brief period of its existence. The chairman of that Board is one of the leading engineers of the country, and he has been ably served by the manager for North Wales. Both  these gentlemen have a passion for rural electricity development, and we have the utmost confidence in them. Whatever economies are contemplated by the Government, I appeal to them as fervently as I possibly can not in any way to retard the progress of rural electrification. In conclusion, may I reiterate that Wales is a nation, and a nation determined to live, as is evidenced in our slogans:
