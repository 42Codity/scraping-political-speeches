Yes, and Surrey too. For many centuries we have been happy to consider ourselves as living in This fortress built by Nature for herselfâ€¦ This little world This precious stone set in the silver sea. But let not our insularity blind us to the fact that, as a major trading nation, we need to develop the best modern airport and seaport facilities. I was pleased to hear the Secretary of State for Social Services yesterday announce that attendance allowances were being substantially increased. I know from many of my constituents how useful they have found attendance allowances, particularly for the mentally retarded child or adult who cannot be left alone. In past days, such handicapped people would have had to be placed in hospital but, thanks to the attendance allowance, they can now often be kept at home. The constant attendance allowance was first introduced by the Conservative Government. I am pleased to see that it is being increased, but I would urge the Secretary of State for Social Services to look closely and urgently at the eligibility criteria for attendance allowances and for disability allowances as well. I believe that there are a number of categories of peopleâ€”for example, the injured young mother with children or those born crippledâ€”for whom the present criteria are a little too harsh. I believe that my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) had in mind a study for easing the eligibility criteria. I hope that the Secretary of State will proceed with such a study with some speed. I want finally to comment on a matter which the Chancellor of the Exchequer raised in his Budget Statement. He spoke about the dizzy rise in commodity prices, including oil, and he looked forward to a possible flattening or even decline in commodity prices during the course of this year. In the past six months we have all been looking for peaks in commodity prices, and we have been disappointed. It is possible that, because of the substantial fall-off in car production in the United States and in Germany over  past months, we shall now see declines in the prices of non-ferrous metals. But, as someone who over past years has worked on the commodity markets, I believe that the rÃ´le of the speculator, though much attention has been given to him, in causing these price rises has been exaggerated greatly. If statistics can be made available, I believe that it will be found that, although the speculator has in some cases caused price rises to happen slightly more quickly than otherwise might have been the case, the amount of positions taken up by non-trade accounts, even in recent hectic months, has been kept within very reasonable levels. It has been suggested that a Royal Commission should examine the commodity markets. I do not think that they have anything to fear from this idea. I believe that they would welcome it, although I cannot say that I think that it would be a suitable instrument. Some years ago the present Prime Minister said that Royal Commissions took years to produce minutes. I urge, rather, the Government to ask each commodity market to look at itself for disciplining purposes. If contracts are anachronistic and out of date and if the differential between one grade of commodity and another is no longer valid, these matters can be put right very quickly by the commodity markets themselves. Equally, margins can be tightened, and clearing house procedures can be improved. These are steps for further disciplines within the commodity markets which could, and should, be taken quickly, and I think that they would be welcomed. As I say, the rÃ´le of the speculator has been exaggerated. The real cause of the rise in commodity prices has been the fact that for nearly a generation since the Korean war we enjoyed the benefit of very stable commodity prices which did not keep up with inflation. In the past two years, with the rapidly increasing pace of inflation and a distrust of currencies, commodity prices have soared. It is noticeable that CIPEC, the organisation of some of the major copper producing countries, showed in its most recent report that, by deflating the sterling price of copper for inflation as reflected in the United Kingdom manufactured goods wholesale price index, the   price of copper, despite its very rapid rise, was actually lower on that deflated basis by some Â£100 per ton in the last quarter of 1973 than in the first quarter of 1966. Thus it is the fact and the fear of inflation which has caused commodity prices to rise and is likely to cause them to remain at their present levels. I regret that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget speech of two days ago, did not do nearly enough to still that fear of continuing inflation.
