I wish to support the plea which has been put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham (Mr. Hale). I think that a very  sound case has been Made for Plymouth on the figures. I think it will be found, in several instances where revision is taking place, that there are fewer than 47,000 electors. My difficulty is that the membership of Plymouth has been reduced at a time when the datum line shows that the electorate is over 47,000. It is difficult to be convinced by the argument against this request, when the electorate in other instances will be less than 47,000. My right hon. Friend suggested that it is impossible in the present circumstances for him to give way, because if he did so, the same plea might be put forward in regard to other constituencies throughout the country. I suggest that my right hon. Friend will not be able to find a case similar to Plymouth. It was suggested some weeks ago that there were to be a number of changes made in respect of certain constituencies, and I confess that I have been very disappointed to find that Plymouth has not been included among those changes. I am disappointed, because I think that the claims of Plymouth are second to none.
