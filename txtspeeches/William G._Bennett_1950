I am deeply conscious that housing is one of the most controversial subjects one could enter into on a maiden speech, and for that reason I crave the indulgence of the Committee. There have been many speeches this afternoon, and we all seem to be agreed on the principle that need must be the first priority. We appear to have accepted the principle that a house, whenever and wherever built, will be allocated to the person who has the greatest necessity. That being so, I should like to give one or two facts and figures showing that in Scotland, at least, Glasgow has the greatest need. I am going to make a special plea for Glasgow. The hon. Lady the Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mrs. Mann) said that private enterprise never provided the goods, could not provide the goods and never would provide the goods. The goods in question are houses for the people. I want to remind the Committee that until 1914 private enterprise alone provided all the houses for Glasgow.
