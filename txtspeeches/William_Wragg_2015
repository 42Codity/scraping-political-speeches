It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (James Berry), and the hon. Members for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan) and for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Alan Brown), who all made excellent maiden speeches. I am grateful, as a former teacher, to be afforded the opportunity to make my maiden speech during this debate. Only time will tell if my audience this evening is as receptive as my former students, or indeed, whether the Secretary of State will rate my speech, through the lens of Ofsted, as either â€œOutstandingâ€ or â€œGoodâ€â€”or perhaps â€œRequiring Improvementâ€, although I hope not â€œInadequateâ€. It is the greatest honour of my life to have been elected to this House as the Member of Parliament for my lifelong home of Hazel Grove. I pay tribute to my predecessor, Sir Andrew Stunell, who retired at the last election. Sir Andrew had been an assiduous Member for the constituency since 1997 and was held in high regard by many. He secured a reputation as a strong constituency MP, which is something I seek to emulate. I wish him and his wife, Gillian, a happy retirement. Since arriving at this House, I have been very disappointed by hon. Membersâ€™ geography skillsâ€”there is clearly some work to be done there, Minister. When I say â€œHazel Groveâ€, the question all too often has been, â€œWhereâ€™s that?â€ Saying â€œNear Stockportâ€ helps some. â€œNear Manchesterâ€ helps a few more, but so far â€œThe Northâ€ has sufficed for most. Indeed, several hon. Members have inquired not â€œWhere?â€, but rather â€œWho?â€ this newbie by the name of â€œHazel Groveâ€ isâ€”only to be disappointed that she is not one of â€œCameronâ€™s cutiesâ€. â€œHazel Groveâ€ is not simply my weekend name; it is the constituency of my birth, where I was educated and have lived all my life. If the orientation and name of the constituency confuses hon. Members, the fact that it contains numerous and varied villages and small towns besides Hazel Grove itself will only muddy the waters further. From Bredbury and Woodley in the north to High Lane in the south, and from Marple Bridge and Compstall in the east to Offerton and Great Moor in the west, the constituency is united by a rich history and strong community spirit. It was Marple where John Bradshaw, lead judge at the trial of Charles I, heralded from. The same place gave Agatha Christie the name of her eponymous detective heroine. Lacking inspiration one day, her trained pulled into Marple station and out of the windowâ€”there it wasâ€”the character of Miss Marple was born. Parts of my constituency feature in the Domesday book. In 1066, Bredbury, Romiley, Norbury and Ludworth collectively generated a total taxable income of Â£7. I am pleased to inform the House that living standards, as well as tax receipts, have risen in the area considerably since then, not least in recent times, because of Her Majestyâ€™s Governmentâ€™s long-term economic plan. The name â€œHazel Groveâ€ came about in 1836 as a rebranding exercise. The old name, â€œBullock Smithyâ€, had somewhat negative connotations. It was infamous for drunkenness and criminalityâ€”indeed, the number of pubs and alehouses rivalled the number in the Palace of Westminster. In 1750, the Methodist leader John Wesley preached in Bullock Smithy, describing it as â€œone of the most famous villages in the country for all manner of wickedness.â€ Quite what he would have made of the Westminster village, I am not too sure. However, he was kinder to another part of my constituency, Mellor, describing the views from the foothills of the Pennines as â€œparadiseâ€. As Hazel Grove is a commuter district of Greater Manchester, the issues of travel, public transport, road and rail links receive a great deal of attention from local residents. I have long campaigned for improvements to road schemes and the A6 to M60 link road in particular is something that I am keen to see delivered. Other priorities of mine will be to champion improvements in local healthcare, including in mental health provision. I also hope that my experience as a teacher will stand me in good stead for pursuing improvements in education for our children, so that they can get the best start in life and fully develop their talents. I would like to place it on the record that the children I have taught and worked with have been the single greatest inspiration to me: their creativity, humour and resilience are truly qualities to be cherished. I am pleased that the new Government intend to further improve education, particularly in the area of funding by protecting the total schools budget and introducing a fairer funding formula, so that similar pupils get the same funding, no matter what part of the country they live in. The Bill concerns raising the standards in our schools still further through their conversion to academies, where that is deemed to be the most appropriate course of action. Part of the Governmentâ€™s plan for education over the next five years is to tackle coasting schools. For some of those schools, becoming an academy may be the best route to sustained improvement. However, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education has made clear, where head teachers have a plan and the capacity to deliver it, they will be given time to improve on their own. I welcome the approach that has been taken by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in engaging with the teaching profession. A collaborative approach is the best way to secure improvements. The Workload Challenge was a positive step from the Government and I would like to see more of that approach. We need to take seriously the issue of teacher retention and morale. Above all, we must endeavour to make the Ofsted process more something that is done with, rather than done to, schools. It has been a pleasure to make my maiden speech in the House today. I am proud to support the Bill, delighted to speak in this debate and honoured to serve my constituents in Hazel Grove.
