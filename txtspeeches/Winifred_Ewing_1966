I have the honour to represent in this House the constituency of Hamilton. My predecessor represented that constituency for 24 years. In a long campaign, I found that thousands of my constituents had met my predecessor personally and many spoke of him as a man who had actually solved a problem for them. They made it plain to me that the only way for any M.P. to stay in Hamilton was to give the kind of service which my predecessor gave, personally, diligently and patiently. Although I have never met him, I would begin by paying tribute to him.
